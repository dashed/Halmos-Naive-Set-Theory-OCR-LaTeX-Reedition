NANYE SEI Tnon 1 DEC, erty of g is the fact that g(A) (which always includes 4) contains at most one more element than Now, to facilitate the exposition, we introduce temporary definition_ We ghall gay that & subcollection J of T is & tower if (i) $ € 3, (ii) 1 A < J, then g(4) € 3, (iii) if @ is & chain in J, then UAae A €J. Towers   surely the whole collection I is one Since  the intersec- tion of & collection of towers is again & tower, it follows, in particuler, that if Jo is the intersection of all towers, then Jo is the smallest tower_ Our immediate purpose is to prove that the tower Jo is & chain. Let us say that & set € in Jo is comparable if it is comparable with every set in Jo; this means that if A Jo, then either A € C o € € A. To say that Jo i8 & chain means that all the sets in Jo ere comparable Comparable sets surely 0 i8 one of them In the next couple of paragraphs We concentrate our attention on an arbitrary but temporarily fixed comparable set C Suppose that A Jo and A ig & proper subset of C. Assertion: g(A) € C. The reason is that since C js comparable, either g(A) C C o C is & proper subset of g(A). In the latter case A is & proper subset of & proper subset of 9(4), and this contradicts the fact that g(A) A cannot be more than singleton. Consider next the collection U of &ll those sets A in Jo for which either A € C o g(C) € A_ The collection U is gomewhat smaller than the col- lection of sets in Jo comparable with 9(C) ; indeed if U, then, since C Cg(C) , either A C g(C) 9(C) € A. Assertion: U is a tower_ Since $ € C, the first condition on towers is satisfied. To prove the second condition, that if A U, then 9(A) U, split the discussion into three cases_ First : A is & proper subset of C. Then g(A) € € by the preceding paragraph, and therefore g(A) Second: A C Then g(A) 9(C) , s0 that g(C) 9(A), and therefore g(A) Third: g(C) € A. Then 9(C) € 9(A), therefore g(A) The third condition on towers that the union of a chain in U belongs to 9, is immediate the defini- tion of U. Conclusion: U is & tower included in Jo, and therefore, since Jo is the smallest tower, U Jo: The preceding considerations imply that for each comparable set C the set 9(C) is comparable also. Reason : given C , form U a8 above; the fact that & Jo means that if 4 Jo, then either A C C (in which case A € 9(C)) o g(C) € 4= Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN exist; exist; ie , and i.e , from
