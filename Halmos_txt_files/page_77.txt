of $g$ is the fact that $g(A)$ (which always includes $A$) contains at most one more element than $A$.

Now, to facilitate the exposition, we introduce a temporary definition. We shall say that a subcollection $\mathcal{J}$ of $\mathcal{X}$ is a \textit{tower} if 

\begin{align*} 
(i)& \: \emptyset \in \mathcal{J} , \\
(ii)& \: if \: A \in \mathcal{J}, \: then \: g(A) \in \mathcal{J} ,\\
(iii)& if \: \mathcal{C} \text{ \textit{is a chain in} } \mathcal{J}, \: then \: \bigcup_{A \in \mathcal}C}} A \in \mathcal{J}. 
\end{align*}

Towers surely exist; the whole collection $\mathcal{X}$ is one. Since the intersection of a collection of towers is again a tower, it follows, in particuler, that if $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is the intersection of all towers, then $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is the smallest tower. Our immediate purpose is to prove that the tower $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is a chain. 

Let us say that a set $C$ in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is \textit{comparable} if it is comparable with every set in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$; this means that if $A \in \mathcal{J}_{0}$, then either $A \subset C$ or $C \subset A$. To say that $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is a chain means that all the sets in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ are comparable. Comparable sets surely exist: $\emptyset$ is one of them. In the next couple of paragraphs we concentrate our attention on an arbitrary but temporarily fixed comparable set $C$. 

Suppose that $A \in \mathcal{J}_{0}$ and $A$ is a proper subset of $C$. Assertion: $g(A) \subset C$. The reason is that since $C$ is comparable, either $g(A) subset C$ or $C$ is a proper subset of $g(A)$. In the latter case $A$ is a proper subset of a proper subset of $g(A)$, and this contradicts the fact that $g(A) - A$ cannot be more than a singleton. 

Consider next the collection $\mathcal{U}$ of all those sets $A$ in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ for which either $A \subset C$ or $g(C) \subset A$. The collection $\mathcal{U}$ is somewhat smaller than the collection of sets in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ comparable with $g(C)$; indeed if $A \in \mathcal{U}$, then, since $C \subset g(C)$, either $A \subset g(C)$ or $g(C) \subset A$. Assertion: $\mathcal{U}$ is a tower. Since $\emptyset \subset C$, the first condition on towers is satisfied. To prove the second condition, i.e., that if $A \in \mathcal{U}$, then $g(A) \in \mathcal {U}$, split the discussion into three cases. First : $A$ is a proper subset of $C$. Then $g(A) \subset C$ by the preceding paragraph, and therefore $g(A) \in \mathcal{U}$. Second: $A = C$. Then $g(A) = g(C)$, so that $g(C) \subset g(A)$, and therefore $g(A) \in \mathcal{U}$. Third: $g(C) \subset A$. Then $g(C) \subset g(A)$, and therefore $g(A) \in \mathcal{U}$. The third condition on towers, i.e., that the union of a chain in $\mathcal{U}$ belongs to $\mathcal{U}$, is immediate from the definition of $\mathcal{U}$. Conclusion: $\mathcal{U}$ is a tower included in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$, and therefore, since $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is the smallest tower, $\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{J}_{0}$. 

The preceding considerations imply that for each comparable set $C$ the set $g(C)$ is comparable also. Reason: given $C$, form $\mathcal{U}$ as above; the fact that $\mathcal{U} = \mathcal{J}_{0}$ means that if $A \in \mathcal{J}_{0}$, then either $A \subset C$ (in which case $A \subset g(C)$) or $g(C) \subset A$.
