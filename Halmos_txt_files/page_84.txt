PROOF. The proof of uniqueness is an easy transfinite induction. To prove existence, recall that a function from $W$ to $X$ is a certain kind of subset of $W \times X$; we shall construct $U$ explicitly as a set of ordered pairs. Call a subset $A$ of $W \times X$ $f$\textit{-closed} if it has the following property: whenever $a \in W$ and $t$ is a sequence of type $a$ included in $A$ (that is, $(c, t(c)) \in A$ for all $c$ in the initial segment $s(a)$), then $(a,f(t)) \in A$. Since $W \times X$ itself is $f$-closed, such sets do exist; let $U$ be the intersection of them all. Since $U$ itself is $f$-closed, it remains only to prove that $U$ is a function. We are to prove, in other words, that for each $c$ in $W$ there exists at most one element $x$ in $X$ such that $(c,x) \in U$. (Explicitly: if both $(c, x)$ and $(c,y)$ belong to $U$, then $x = y$.) The proof is inductive. Let $S$ be the set of all those elements $c$ of $W$ for which it is indeed true that $(c, x) \in U$ for at most one $x$. We shall prove that if $s(a) \subset S$, then $a \in S$. 

To say that $s(a) \subset S$ means that if $c < a$ in $W$, then there existe a unique element $x$ in $X$ such that $(c, x) \in U$. The correspondence $c \rigtharrow x$ thereby defined is a sequence of type $a$, say $t$, and $t \subset U$. If $a$ does not belong to $S$, then $(a,y) \in U$ for some $y$ different from $f(t)$. Assertion: the set $U - \{ (a, y) \}$ is $f$-closed. This means that if $b \in W$ and if $r$ is a sequence of type $b$ included in $U - \{ (a, y) \}$, then $(b,f(r)) \in U - \{ (a, y) \}$. Indeed, if $b =a$, then $r$ must be $t$ (by the uniqueness assertion of the theorem), and the reason the diminished set contains $(b, f(r))$ is that $f(t) \neq y$; if, on the other hand, $b \neq a$, then the reason the diminished set contains $(b,f(r))$ is that $U$ is $f$-closed (and $b \neq a$). This contradicts the fact that $U$ is the smallest $f$-closed set, and we may conclude that $a \in S$. 

The proof of the existence assertion of the transfinite recursion theorem is complete. An application of the transfinite recursion theorem is called \textit{definition by transfinite induction}. 

We continue with an important part of the theory of order, which, incidentally, will also serve as an illustration of how the transfinite recursion theorem can be applied. 

Two partially ordered sets (which may in particular be totally prdered and even well ordered) are called \textit{similar} if there exists an order-preserving one-to-one correspondence between them. More explicitly: to say of the partially ordered sets $X$ and $Y$ that they are similar (in symbols $X \tilde{=} Y$} means that there exists a one-to-one correspondence, say $f$, from $X$ onto $Y$, such that if $a$ and $b$ are in $X$, then a necessary and sufficient condition that $f(a) \le f(b)$ (in $Y$) is that $a \le b$ (in $X$). A correspondence such as $f$ is sometimes called \textit{similarity}. 

\begin{named}[Exercise. ] Prove that a similarity preserves $<$ (in the same sense in which the definition demands the preservation of $\le$) and that, in fact, a one-to-one function that maps one partially ordered set onto another is a similarity if and only if preserves $<$.
