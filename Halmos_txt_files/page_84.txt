18 TRANSFINITE RECURSION ROOF . The of uniquenesg is &n easy transfinite induction. To ve existence, recall that function to X is & certain kind of et of W X X; we shall construct U explicitly &8 & set of ordered pairs_ subset A of W X X f-closed if it has the following property: when- " @ € W and t is & gequence of type & included in A (that is, (c, t(c)) € 4 all c in the initial segment s(a)) , then (a,f(0)) € A. Since W X X itsell closed, such sets do exist; let U be the intersection of them all. Sinco tself is f-closed, it remains only to prove that U is & function. We are rove, in other words, that for each c in W there exists at most one ele- t € in X such that (C,x) € U. (Explicitly: if both (C, x) and (c,y) be- to U, then y.) The proof is inductive: Let S be the get of &ll se elements € of W for which it is indeed true that (C, 1) € U for &t most We ghall prove that if s(a) € S, then 0 € '0 say that s(a) C S means that if € <a in W, then there existe & unique nent in X such that (C, *) € U. The correspondence thereby ned is & sequence of type &, gay t, and t € U. If a does not to hen (a,y) € U for some y different from f() Assertion: the set U y) } is f-closed. This means that if b € W and if r is & sequence of type cluded in U {(a, y) } , then (6,f(r)) € U {(a, y)} _ Indeed , if b hen must be t (by the uniqueness assertion of the theorem) , and the on the diminished set contains (b, f(r)) is that f() # y; if, on the other b 7 @, then the reason the diminished set contains (b,f(r)) is that f-closed (and b = a). This contradicts the fact that U is the smallest sed set, &nd we may conclude that a S. 'he proof of the existence assertion of the transfinite recursion theorem omplete. An application of the transfinite recursion theorem is called nition by transfinite induction. Ve continue with an important part of the theory of order, which, inci- tally, will also serve &8 an illustration of how the transfinite recursion )rem can be applied. 'wo partially ordered sets (which may in particular be totally ordered even well ordered) are called similar if there exists an order-preserving -to-one correspondence between them. More explicitly: to say of the tially ordered sets X and Y that they are similar (in symbols X = Y} ns that there exists one-to-one correspondence, say f, from X onto that if a and b are in X, then 8 necessary and sufficient condition  f(a) < f(b) (in Y) is that a & b (in X).
