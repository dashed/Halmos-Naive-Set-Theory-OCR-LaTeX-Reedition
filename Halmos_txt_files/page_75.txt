\chapter{SECTION 16: ZORN'S LEMMA}

An existence theorem asserts the existence of an object belonging to a certain set and possessing certain properties. Many existence theorems can be formulated (or, if need be, reformulated) so that the underlying set is a partially ordered set and the crucial property is maximality. Our next purpose is to state and prove the most important theorem of this kind.

\begin{named}[Zorn's lemma. ] If $X$ is a partially ordered set such that every chain in $X$ has an upper bound, then $X$ contains a maximal element. 
\end{named}

DISCUSSION. Recall that a chain is a totally ordered set. By a chain "in $X$" we mean a subset of $X$ such that the subset, considered as a partially ordered set on its own right, turns out to be totally ordered. If $A$ is a chain in $X$, the hypothesis of Zorn's lemma guarantees the existence of an upper bound for $A$ in $X$; it does not guarantee the existence of an upper bound for $A$ in $A$. The conclusion of Zorn's lemma is the existence of an element $a$ in $X$ with the property that if $a \le x$, then necessarily $a = x$. 

The basic idea of the proof is similar to the one used in our preceding discussion of infinite sets. Since, by hypothesis, $X$ is not empty, it has an element, say $x_{0}$. If $x_{0}$ is maximal, stop here. If it is not, then there exists an element, say $x_{1}$, strictly greater than $x_{0}$. If $x_{1}$ is maximal, stop here; otherwise continue. Repeat this argument ad infinitum; ultimately it must lead to a maximal element. 

The last sentence is probably the least convincing part of the argument; it hides a multitude of difficulties. Observe, for instance, the following possibility. It could happen that the argument, repeated ad infinitum, leads to a whole infinite sequence of non-maximal elements; what are we to do in that case? The answer is that the range of such an infinite sequence is a chain in $X$, and, consequently, has an upper bound; the thing to do is to start the whole argument all over again, beginning with that
