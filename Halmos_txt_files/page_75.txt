SECTION 16 ZORN'S  LEMMA An existence theorem asserts the existence of an object belonging to certain set and possessing certain   properties_ Many existence theorems can be formulated (Or, if need be, reformulated) 80 that the underlying set ig & partially ordered set and the crucial property is maximality_ Our next purpose is to gtate prove the most important theorem of this kind. Zorn'8 lemma. If X i8 @ partially ordered get such that _ chain in X ha8 an upper bound, then X contains & marimal element. DISCUSSION Recall that chain is totally ordered set_ By chain "in X" we mean subset of X such that the subset, considered as & par- tially ordered set on its own right, turns out to be totally ordered. If A is chain in X, the hypothesis of Zorn'8 lemma guarantees the existence of an upper bound for A in X;it does not guarantee the existence of an upper bound for A in A. The conclusion of Zorn'g lemma is the existence of an element & in X with the property that if a & <, then necessarily a The basic idea of the proof is 8imilar to the one our preceding discussion of infinite gets.  Since, by hypothesis, X is not empty, it has an element, 88y %o: If To is maximal, here. If it i8 not, then there exists an element, say %1, strictly greeter than To: If T1 is maximal, stop here; otherwige continue. Repeat this  argument ad infinitum; ultimately it must lead to & maximal element_ The last sentence is probably the least convincing part of the argument; it hides multitude of difficulties_ Observe, for instance, the following possibility. It could happen that the argument, repeated &d infinitum leads to whole infinite sequence of non-maximal elements; what are we to do in that case? The answer is that the range of such an infinite se- quence i8 & chain in X, and, consequently, has an upper bound; the to do i8 to 8tart the whole argument &ll over again, beginning with that Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN and every uged stop thing
