\chapter{SECTION 18 TRANSFINITE RECURSION} 

The process of "definition by induction" has a   transfinite analogue. The ordinary recursion theorem constructs a function on $\omega$; the raw material is a way of getting the value of the function at each non-zero element $n$ of $\omega$ from its value at the element preceding $n$. The transfinite analogue constructs a function on any well ordered set $W$; the raw material is a way of getting the value of the function at each element $a$ of $W$ from its values at all the predecessors of $a$. 

To be able to state the result concisely, we introduce some auxiliary concepts: If $a$ is an element of a well ordered set $W$, and if $X$ is an arbitrary set, then by a \textit{sequence of type a in $X$} we shall mean a function from the initial segment of $a$ in $W$ into $X$. The sequences of type $a$, for $a$ in $\omega^{+}$, are just what we called sequences before, finite or infinite according as $a < \omega$ or $a =  \omega$. If $U$ is a function from $W$ to $X$, then the restriction of $U$ to the initial segment $s(a)$ of $a$ is an example of a sequence of type $a$ for each $a$ in $W$; in what follows we shall find it convenient to denote that sequence by $U^{a}$ (instead of $U | s(a)$).

A \textit{sequence function of type $W$ in $X$} is a function $f$ whose domain consists of all sequences of type $a$ in $X$, for all elements $a$ in $W$, and whose range is included in $X$. Roughly speaking, a sequence function tells us how "lengthen" a sequence; given a sequence that stretches up to (but not including) some element of $W$ we can use a sequence function to tack on one more term. 

\begin{named}[Transfinite recursion theorem. ] If $W$ is a well ordered set, and if $f$ is a sequence function of type $W$ in a set $X$, then there exists a unique function $U$ from $W$ into $X$ such that $U(a) = f(U^{a})$ for each $a$ in $W$.
