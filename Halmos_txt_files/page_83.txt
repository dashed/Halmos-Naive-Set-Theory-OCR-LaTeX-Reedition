SECTION 18 TRANSFINITE RECURSION The procegg  of "definition by induction" has 8   trangfinite analogue The ordinary recursion theorem constructs function on @; the raw mate- rial is & way of getting the velue of the function at each non-zero element n of @ from its velue at the element preceding The transfinite analogue constructs function on any well ordered set W ; the raw material i8 way of getting the value of the function at each element a of W from its values &t all the predecessors of a. To be able to state the result concisely , we introduce some auxiliary concepts: If a is an element of 4 well ordered set W, and if X is an arbi- trary set, then by & sequence of type a in X we shall mean & function from the initial segment of a in W into X. The sequences of type @, for & in W are just what we called sequences before, finite or infinite according &8 W Or & If U is 9 function from W to X, then the restriction of U to the initial gegment s(a) of & is an example of & gequence of type & for each in W; in what followg we shall find it convenient to denote that sequence by Ua (instead of U | s(a)) sequence function of type W in X is & function f whose domain congists of all sequences of type a in X, for all elements & in W, and whose range is included in X Roughly speaking, bequence function  tells u8 how "lengthen" sequence; given sequence that stretches up to (but not in- cluding) some element of W we can use sequence function to tack on one more term Transfinite recursion theorem. If W is a well ordered set, and if f is sequence function of type W in a set X, then there ezists @ unique function W into X such that U(a) f(U") for each a in W 70 Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN U jrom
