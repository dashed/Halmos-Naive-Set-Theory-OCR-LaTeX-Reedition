$(n^{+}, f(x)). In other words, $u - \{ (0, b) \} \in \mathcal{C}$. This contradicts the fact that $u$ is the smallest set in $\mathcal{C}$, and we may conclude that $0 \in S$. 

Suppose now that $n \in S$; this means that there exists a unique element $x$ in $X$ such that $(n, x) \in u$. Since $(n, x) \in u$, it follows that $(n^{+}, f(x)) \in u$. If $n^{+}$ does not belong to $S$, then $(n^{+}, y) \in u$ for some $y$ different from $f(x)$. Consider, in this case, the set $u - \{ (n^{+}, y) \}$. Observe that this diminished set contains $(0, a)$ (since $n^{+} \neq 0$), and that if the diminished set contains $(m, t)$, say, then it contains $(m^{+}, f(t))$ also. Indeed, if $m = n$, then $t$ must be $x$, and the reason the diminished set contains $(n^{+}, f(x))$ is that $f(x) \neq y$; if, on the other hand, $m \neq n$, then the reason the diminished set contains $(m^{+}, f(t))$ is that $m^{+} \neq n^{+}$. In other words, $u - \{ ( n^{+}, y) \} \in \mathcal{C}$. This again contradicts the fact that $u$ is the smallest set in $\mathcal{C}$, and we may conclude that $n^{+} \in S$. 

The proof of the recursion theorem is complete. An application of the recursion theorem is called \textit{definition by induction}. 

\begin{named}[Exercise. ] Prove that if $n$ is a natural number, then $n \neq n^{+}$; if $n \neq 0$, then $n = m^{+}$ for some natural number $m$. Prove that $ \omega $ is transitive. Prove that if $E$ is a non-empty subset of some natural number, then there exists an element $k$ in $E$ such that $k \in m$ whenever $m$ is an element of $E$ distinct from $k$.
