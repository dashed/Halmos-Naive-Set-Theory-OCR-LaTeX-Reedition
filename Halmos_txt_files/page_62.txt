Suppose now that n € S; this means that there exists & unique element in X such that (n, z) Since (n, *) U, it follows that (n f(z)) n + does not to S, then (n for some y different from f(c). onsider , in this case, the set u {(n y)}. Observe that this diminished t contains (0, a) (since n #0), that if the diminished set contains 1,t) , say , then it contains (m +, f(C)) also. Indeed, if m =n, then must 1,and the reason the diminished set contains (n + f(z)) is that f(c) # y; on the other hand, m = n, then the reason the diminished set contains f()) is that m #n In other words {(n y)} This ain  contradicts the fact that & is the smallest set in @, and we may nclude that n + e $. The of the recursion theorem is complete. An application of the cursion theorem is called definition by induction. ExERCISE, Prove that if n is a natural number, then n # n +; if n # 0, then for some natural number m. Prove that W i8 transitive Prove that if E is & non-empty subset of some natural number, then there exists an element k in E such that k whenever m is an element of E distinct from k.
