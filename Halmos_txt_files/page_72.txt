SECTION 15 THE AXIOM OF CHOICE For the deepest results about partially ordered getg we need & new get- oretic tool_ we interrupt the development of the theory of order ugh to pick up that tool, Ve begin by observing that 9 set is either empty O it i8 not, and, if it is then, by the definition of the empty set, there i8 an element in it_ is remark can be generalized If X and Y are sets, and if one of them is pty, then the Cartesian product X X Y is empty: If neither X nor mpty, then there is an element z in X, and there is gn element y in Y; follows that the ordered (1, y) belongs to the Cartesian  product X Y, 80 that X X Y is not empty_ The preceding remarks constitute cases n = 1 and 2 of the following assertion: if {X:} is finite quence of sets, for i in 7, gay, then necessary and gufficient condition t their Cartesian product be empty is that at least one of them be empty. assertion ig easy to prove by induction o n (The case n 0 leads to lippery argument about the empty function; the uninterested reader mey rt his induction at instead of 0.)
