\chapter{SECTION 15: THE AXIOM OF CHOICE} 

For the deepest results about partially ordered sets we need a new set-theoretic tool; we interrupt the development of the theory of order long enough to pick up that tool. 

We begin by observing that a set is either empty or it is not, and, if it is not, then, by the definition of the empty set, there is an element in it. This remark can be generalized. If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, and if one of them is empty, then the Cartesian product $X \times Y$ is empty. If neither $X$ nor $Y$ is empty, then there is an element $x$ in $X$, and there is an element $y$ in $Y$; it follows that the ordered pair $(x, y)$ belongs to the Cartesian product $X \times Y$, so that $X \times Y$ is not empty. The preceding remarks constitute thes cases $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ of the following assertion: if $\{ X_{i} \}$ is a finite sequence of sets, for $i$ in $n$, say, then a necessary and sufficient condition that their Cartesian product be empty is that at least one of them be empty. The assertion is easy to prove by induction on $n$. (The case $n = 0$ leads to a slippery argument about the empty function; the uninterested reader may start his induction at $1$ instead of $0$.) 

The generalization to infinite families of the non-trivial part of the assertion in the preceding paragraph (necessity) is the following important principle of set theory.

In other words: if $\{ X_{i} \}$ is a family of non-empty sets indexed by a non-empty set $I$, then there exists a family $\{ x_{i} \}$, $i \in I$, such that $x_{i} \in X_{i}$ for each $i$ in $I$. 

Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a non-empty collection of non-empty sets. We may regard $\mathcal{C}$ as a family, or, to say it better, we can convert $\mathcal{C}$ into an indexed just by using the collection $\mathcal{C}$ itself in the role of the index set and using the identity mapping on $\mathcal{C}$ in the role of the indexing.
