Observe that the order of events is important in the theory of functional composition. In order that gf be defined; the range of f must be included in the domain of g, and this can happen without it necessarily happening in the other direction at the game time: Even if both fg and gf are defined which happens if, for instance, f maps X into Y and g maps Y into X, the functions fg and gf need not be the same; in other words, functional compo sition i8 not necessarily commutative. Functional composition may not be commutative; but it is always ass0- ciative. If f maps X into Y, if g maps Y into Z, and if h maps Z into U_ then we can form the composite of h with gf and the composite of hg with f;it is & simple exercise to show that the result is the game in either case_ The connection between inversion &nd composition is important; some- like it crops up all over mathematics. If f maps X into Y and g maps Y into %, then f- maps P(Y) into P(X) and g maps P(Z) into c(Y)  In this situation, the composites that are formable are gf and f-Ig -1; the assertion is that the latter ig the inverse of the former. Proof : if r € (gf) -1(C) , where I & X and C €z, then g(f(c)) € C, 80 that f(z) '(C), and therefore 26f-!(g-'(C)); the steps of the argument are reversible: Inversion and composition for functiong are special cases of similar opera- tiong for relations_ Thus, in particuler, associated with every relation R from X to Y there is the inverse (Or converse) relation R -l from Y to X; by definition y R-1 z means that € R y: Example: if R is the relation of be- longing; from X to G(X), then R~1 is the relation of containing, from P(X) to X It is an immediate consequence of the definitions involved that dom R- ran R ran dom R If the relation R is & function_ then the equivalent  assertions Ry and can be  written in  the equivalent forms R(c) y and z € R-'(ly)): Because of difficulties with commutativity, the generalization of func- tional composition bas to be bendled with care_ The composite of the rela- tions R and S ig defined in case R is & relation from X to Y and $ is & rela- Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN thing thing 9~!
