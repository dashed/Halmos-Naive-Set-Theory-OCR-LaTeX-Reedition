IUU FffyD DL _ TTDON 1 DEC least element of & well ordered set is the only one thet geems to clamor for special attention. We are now prepared for the definition: & cardinal number is an ordinal number such that if 8 is &n ordinal number equivalent to (i.e:, card 8) , then < The ordinal numbers with this property have also been called initial numbers. If X is set, then card X_ the cardinal number of X (also known a8 the power of X), is the least ordinal number equivalent to X ExERCISE_ Prove that each infinite cardinal number is & limit number Since each set is equivalent to its cardinal number, it follows that if card X card Y, then X ~ Y. If, conversely, X ~ Y, then card X card Y. Since card X is the least ordinal number equivalent to X, it fol- lows that card X < card Y, and, since the situation is symmetric in X and Y, we also have card Y & card X. In other wordg card X card Y if and only if X Y; this was one of the conditions on cardinal numbers that we needed in the development of cardinal arithmetic A finite ordinal number (i.e , & natural number) is not equivalent to any finite ordinal number distinct from itself It follows that if X is finite, then the set of ordinal numbers equivalent to X is & singleton, and, con- sequently, the cardinal number of X is the same the ordinal number of X. Both cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers are generalizations of the natural numbers; in the familiar finite cases both the generalizations coin- cide with the special case that gave rise to them in the first place. As an almost trivial application of these remark8, we can now calculate the car- dinal number of & power set P(A): if card A = @, then card P(A) 2" (Note that the result, though simple, could not have been stated before this; till now we did not know that 2 is & cardinal number:) The proof is immediate from the fact that G(A) is equivalent to 24_ If and 8 are ordinal numbers, we know what it means to say that 4B. It follows that cardinal numbers come to u8 automati- cally equipped with an order: The order satisfieg the conditions we rowed   for our discussion of   cardinal  arithmetic_ Indeed: if card X card Y, then card X j8 8 subset of card Y and it follows that X < Y If we had X Y, then, as we have already we should have card X Y;it follows that we must have X <Y. If, finally, X Y, then it is impossible that card Y < card X (for gimilarity implieg equivalence) , and hence card X card Y As an application of these considerations we mention the inequality 0 < 24 , Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN card bor- seen, card
