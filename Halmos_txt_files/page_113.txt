least element of a well ordered set is the only one thet seems to clamor for special attention. 

We are now prepared for the definition: a \textit{cardinal number} is an ordinal number $\alpha$ such that if $\beta$ is an ordinal number equivalent to $\alpha$ (i.e., card $\alpha =$ card $\beta$), then $\alpha \le \beta$. The ordinal numbers with this property have also been called \textit{initial numbers}. If $X$ is a set, then card $X$, the cardinal number of $X$ (also known as the \textit{power} of $X$), is the least ordinal number equivalent to $X$.

Since each set is equivalent to its cardinal number, it follows that if card $X =$ card $Y$, then $X \sim Y$. If, conversely, $X \sim Y$, then card $X \sim $ card $Y$. Since card $X$ is the least ordinal number equivalent to $X$, it follows that card $X \le $ card $Y$, and, since the situation is symmetric in $X$ and $Y$, we also have card $Y \le $ card $X$. In other words card $X =$ card $Y$ if and only if $X \sim Y$; this was one of the conditions on cardinal numbers that we needed in the development of cardinal arithmetic. 

A finite ordinal number (i.e., a natural number) is not equivalent to any finite ordinal number distinct from itself. It follows that if $X$ is finite, then the set of ordinal numbers equivalent to $X$ is a singleton, and, consequently, the cardinal number of $X$ is the same as the ordinal number of $X$. Both cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers are generalizations of the natural numbers; in the familiar finite cases both the generalizations coincide with the special case that gave rise to them in the first place. As an almost trivial application of these remarks, we can now calculate the cardinal number of a power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$: if card $A = a$, then card $\mathcal{P}(A) = 2^{\alpha}$. (Note that the result, though simple, could not have been stated before this; till now we did not know that $2$ is a cardinal number.) The proof is immediate from the fact that $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is equivalent to $2^{A}$. 

If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers, we know what it means to say that $\alpha < \beta$ or $\alpha \le \beta$. It follows that cardinal numbers come to us automatically equipped with an order. The order satisfies the conditions we borrowed for our discussion of cardinal  arithmetic. Indeed: if card $X <$ card $Y$, then card $X$ is a subset of card $Y$, and it follows that $X \precsim Y$. If we had $X \sim Y$, then, as we have already seen, we should have card $X =$ card $Y$; it follows that we must have $X \prec Y$. If, finally, $X \prec Y$, then it is impossible that card $Y <\le$ card $X$ (for similarity implies equivalence), and hence card $X <$ card $Y$. 

As an application of these considerations we mention the inequality

\begin{equation*}
a < 2^{a},
