SECTION COMPLEMENTS AND POWERS If A and B are sets, the difference between A and B, more often known the relative complement of B in A, is the set A B defined by A ~ B = {r € A:z / B} te that in this definition it is not necessary to assume that B € A: In ler to record the basic facts about complementation &8 simply &8 possi- we assume nevertheless (in this section only) that all the sets to be ntioned are subsets of one the same set E and that all complements nless otherwise specified) are formed relative to that E In such situa- ng (and they are quite common) it is easier to remember the underlying E than to keep writing it down, end this makes it possible to simplify notation: An often used symbol for the temporarily absolute (as op sed to relative) complement of A is A'. In terms of this symbol the sic facts about complementation can be stated &8 followg: (AY = 4, 0' = E, E = 0, A n A' = $, 4 U A' = E, A € B if and only if B' € A'. e most important statements about complements are the s0-called De organ laws: (A U BY = A' 0 B' , (A n BY = A' U B' Te ghall gee presently that the De Morgan laws hold for the uniong and ersections of larger collections of sets than just pairs ) These facts about Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN and
