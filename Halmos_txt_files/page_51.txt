\chapter{SECTION 10: INVERSES AND COMPOSITES}

Associated with every function $f$, from $X$ to $Y$, say, there is a function from $\mathcal{P}(X)$ to $\mathcal{P}(Y)$, namely the function (frequently called $f$ also) that assigns to each subset $A$ of $X$ the image subset $f(A)$ of $Y$. The algebraic behavior of the mapping $A \rigtharrow f(A)$ leaves something to be desired. It is true that if $ \{ A_{i} \} $ is a family of subsets of $X$, then $f( \bigcup_{i} A_{i} ) = \bigcup_{i} f( A_{i} )$ (proof?), but the corresponding equation for intersections is false in general (example?), and the connection between images and complements is equally unsatisfactory. 

A correspondence between the elements of $X$ and the elements of $Y$ does always induce a well-behaved correspondence between the subsets of $X$ and the subsets of $Y$, not forward, by the formation of images, but backward, by the formation of inverse images. Given a function $f$ from $X$ to $Y$, let $f^{-1}$, the \textit{inverse} of $f$, be the function from $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ to $\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that if $B \subset Y$, then

\begin{equation*}
f^{-1}(B) = \{ x \in X : f(x) \in B \} .
\end{equation*}

In words: $f^{-1}(B)$ consists of exactly those elements of $X$ that $f$ maps into $B$; the set $f^{-l}(B)$ is called the \textit{inverse image} of $B$ under $f$. A necessary and sufficient condition that $f$ map $X$ onto $Y$ is that the inverse image under $f$ of each non-empty subset of $Y$ be a non-empty subset of $X$. (Proof?) A necessary and sufficient condition that $f$ be one-to-one is that the inverse image under $f$ of each singleton in the range of $f$ be a singleton in $X$. 

If the last condition is satisfied, then the symbol $f^{-1}$ is frequently assigned a second interpretation, namely as the function whose domain is the range of $f$, and whose value for each $y$ in the range of $f$ is the unique $x$ in $X$ for which $f(x) = y$. In other words, for one-to-one functions $f$ we may write $f^{-1}(y) = x$ if and only if $f(x) = y$. This use of the notation is
