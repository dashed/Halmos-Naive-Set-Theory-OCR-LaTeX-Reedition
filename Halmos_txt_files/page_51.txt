SECTION 10 INVERSES AND COMPOSITES Associated with every function f, from X to Y, gAy, there i8 & function from P(X) to P(Y), namely the function  (frequently called al8o) that assigns to each subset A of X the image gubset f( A) of Y. The algebraic behavior of the mapping A 7 f(A) leaves gomething to be desired_ It is true that if (A,} is & family of gubsets of X, then f(U: 4,) U: f(A;) (proof?), but the corresponding equation for intersections is falge in gen- eral (example?) , and the connection between images and complements is equally unsatisfactory. A correspondence between the elements of X &nd the elements of does always induce & well-behaved correspondence between the gubsets of X and the gubsets of Y, not forward, by the formation of images, but backward, by the formation of inverse images. Given function f from X to Y, let f-} the inverse of f, be the function from P(Y) to P(X) guch that if B â‚¬ Y, then f-'(B) {z e X: f(c)   B}_ In words: f-I(B) consists of exactly those elements of X that f maps into B; the set f-l(B) is called the inverse image of B under f: A necesgary and sufficient condition that f map X onto Y is that the inverge under f of each non-empty gubset of Y be non-empty subset of X_ (Proof?) A necessary and sufficient condition that f be one-to-one is that the inverse image under f of each singleton in the range of f be a gingleton in X. If the last condition is gatisfied, then the gymbol f-1 i8 frequently 98 signed second interpretation, namely 8s the function  whose domain is the range of f, and whose value for each y in the range of f is the unique in X for which f(z) In other words, for one-to-one functions f we may write f-!(y) = [ ff and only if f(z) =y This use of the notation is 38 Original from e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN image
