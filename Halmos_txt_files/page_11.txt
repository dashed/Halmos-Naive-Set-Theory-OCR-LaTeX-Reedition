is the study of just one sane set of axioms with the intention of describing Euclidean geometry only.

	Instead of Naive set theory a more honest title for the book would have been \textit{An outline of the elements of naive set theory}. "Elements" would warn the reader that not everything is here; "outline" would warn him that even what is here needs filling in. The style is usually informal to the point of conversational. There are very few displayed theorems; most of the facts are just stated and followed by a sketch of a proof, very much as they might be in a general descriptive lecture. There are only a few exercises, officially so labelled, but, in fact, most of the book is nothing but a long chain of exercises with hints. The reader should continually ask himself whether he knows how to jump from one hint to the next, and, accordingly, he should not be discouraged if he finds that his reading rate is considerably slower than normal.

	This is not to say that the contents of this book are unusually difficult or profound. What is true is that the concepts are very general and very abstract, and that, therefore, they may take some getting used to. It is a mathematicel truism, however, that the more generally a theorem applies, the less deep it is. The student's task in learning set theory is to steep himself in unfamiliar but essentially shallow generalities till they become so familiar that they can be used with almost no conscious effort. In other words, general set theory is pretty trivial stuff really, but, if you want to be a mathematician, you need some, and here it is; read it, absorb it, and forget it.
