\chapter{SECTION 9: FAMILIES}

There are occasions when the range of a function is deemed to be more important than the function itself. When that is the case, both the terminology and the notation undergo radical alterations. Suppose, for instance, that $x$ is a function from a set $I$ to a set $X$. (The very choice of letters indicates that something strange is afoot.) An element of the domain $I$ is called an \textit{index}, $I$ is called the \textit{index set}, the range of the function is called an \textit{indexed set}, the function itself is called a \textit{family}, and the value of the function $x$ at an index $i$, called a \textit{term} of the family, is denoted by $x_{i}$. (This terminology is not absolutely established, but it is one of the standard choices among related slight veriants; in the sequel it and it alone will be used.) An unacceptable but generally accepted way of communicating the notation and indicating the emphasis is to speak of a family $\{ x_{i}  \}$ in $X$, or of a family $\{ x_{i} \}$ of whatever the elements of $X$ may be; when necessary, the index set $I$ is indicated by some such parenthetical expression as $(i \in I)$. Thus, for instance, the phrase "a family $\{ A_{i} \}$ of subsets of $X$" is usually understood to refer to a function $A$, from some set $I$ of indices, into $\mathcal{P}(X)$. 

If $ \{ A_{i} \}$ is a family of subsets of $X$, the union of the range of the family is called the union of the family $\{ A_{I} \}$, or the union of the sets $A_{i}$; the standard notation for it is

\begin{equation*}
\bigcup_i \in I} \: \text{ or } \: U_{i}A_{i},
\end{equation*}

according as it is or is not important to emphasize the index set $I$. It follows immediately from the definition of unions that $x \in \bigcup_{i} A_{i}$ if and only if $x$ belongs to $A_{i}$ for at least one $i$. If $I = 2$, so that the range of the family $\{ A_{i} \}$ is the unordered $\{ A_{0}, A_{i} \} $, then $\bigcup_{i}A_{i} =  A_{0} \cup A_{1}$. Observe that there is no loss of generality in considering families of sets instead of arbitrary collections of sets; every collection of sets is the range
