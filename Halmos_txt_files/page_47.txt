SECTION FAMILIES There are occasiong when the range of & function ig deemed to be more important than the function itself. When that is the case, both the ter- minology &nd the notation undergo radical alterationg_ Suppose, for in- stance, that I j9 4 function from a Bet to & get X_ (The very choice of letters indicates that gomething strange is afoot ) An element of the do main [ ig called an index, I is called the indez st, the range of the function is called an indered set, the function itself is called & family, and the value of the function c at an index i, called & term of the family, is denoted by %; (This terminology is not absolutely established, but it is one of the standard choices among related slight veriants; in the gequel it end it alone will be used:) An unacceptable but generally accepted way of communicating the notation end indicating the emphasis is to speak of & family {z;} in X, or of a family {z;} of whatever the elements of X may be; when  necessary, the index set I is indicated by gome guch perenthetical expression &s (i € T). Thus, for instance; the phrase %& family (A;} of subsets of X" is ugually understood to refer to & function A, from some get I of indices, into P(X) If (A;} is & family of gubsets of X, the union of the range of the family is called the union of the family {A;}, Or the union of the getg 4;; the standard notation for it i8 U;aI A; or U: A; according 98 it is O is not important to emphasize the index get I. It follows immediately from the definition of unions that I € U: A; if and only if belonge to A; for gt least one i If [ = 2, 80 that the range of the family (A;} is the unordered {Ao, 4,}, then Us A; Ao U A1: Observe that there is no loss of generality in considering families of sets instead of arbitrary collectiong of gets; every collection of gets is the renge 34 Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN pair
