These correspondences can be used to carry over whatever gtructure E and F mey possess (for example, order) to E and F It follows that any time we are given two with without some additional structure, we may always replace them by disjoint sets with the game structure, and hence Fe may assume, with no loss of generality, that they were disjoint in the first place. Before applying this construction to ordinal arithmetic, we obgerve that can be generalized to arbitrary families of sets. If, indeed, {E;} is family , write E; for the get of &ll ordered (1,1), with z in E; (In other words, E; E X {i}) The family E;} i8 pairwise disjoint, it can do anything the original family {E;} could do. Suppose now that E and F are disjoint well ordered sets. Define order in E U F g0 that pairg of elements in E, and al8o pairg of elements in F, retain the order they had, and that each element of E precedes each element of F  (In ultraformal language: if R &nd S are the given order relations  in respectively, let E U F be ordered by R U $ U (EX F)) The fact that E and F were well ordered implies that E U F is well ordered. The well ordered set E U F is called the ordinal sum of well ordered sets E and F There ig an easy and worth while way of extending the concept of ordinal sum to infinitely many summands   Suppose that {E;} is & disjoint family of well ordered gets indexed by well ordered get I. The ordinal sum of the family is the union U: E; ordered followg. If a &nd b are elements of the union, with a € E; and b € Ej, then a < b meang that either i < j or else i =j and a precedes b in the given order of E; The definition of addition for ordinal numbers i8 now child'9 play. For each well ordered get X, let ord X be the unique ordinal number similar to X. (If X is finite, then ord X is the same &s the natural number #(X) de- fined earlier.) If & end 8 are ordinal numbers, let A and B be disjoint well ordered sets with ord A and ord B 8, and let € be the ordinal sum of A and B_ The sum + 8 is, by definition, the ordinal number of C, 80 that A + ord B ord C . It is important to note that the gum + 8 is independent of the particular choice of the sets A and B; any other of disjoint sets, with the game ordinal numbers, would have given the game result. These considerationg extend without difficulty to the infinite cage. If {a;} is & well ordered family of ordinal numbers indexed by & well ordered set I, let {A;} be & disjoint family of well ordered gets with ord A; = for each let A be the ordinal sum of the family (A;} The 8um Ziel ord A;is, by definition, the ordinal number of A, 80 that Zi l A; Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN set8, pair8 and and the ord pair and ord
