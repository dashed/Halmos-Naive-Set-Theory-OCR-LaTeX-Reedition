These correspondences can be used to carry over whatever structure $E$ and $F$ may possess (for example, order) to $\hat{E}$ and $\hat{F}$. It follows that any time we are given two set, with or without some additional structure, we may always replace them by disjoint sets with the same structure, and hence we may assume, with no loss of generality, that they were disjoint in the first place. 

Before applying this construction to ordinal arithmetic, we observe that it can be generalized to arbitrary families of sets. If, indeed, $\{ E_{i} \}$ is a family, write $\hat{E}_{i}$ for the set of all ordered pairs $(x,i)$, with $x$ in $E_{i}$. (In other words, $\hat{E}_{i} = E_{i} X \{ i \}$.) The family $\{ \hat{E}_{i} \}$ is pairwise disjoint, and it can do anything the original family $\{ E_{i} \}$ could do. 

Suppose now that $E$ and $F$ are disjoint well ordered sets. Define order in $E \cup F$ so that pairs of elements in $E$, and also pairs of elements in $F$, retain the order they had, and so that each element of $E$ precedes each element of $F$. (In ultraformal language: if $R$ and $S$ are the given order relations in $E$ and $F$ respectively, let $E \cup F$ be ordered by $R \cup S \cup (E \times F)$.) The fact that $E$ and $F$ were well ordered implies that $E \cup F$ is well ordered. The well ordered set $E \cup F$ is called the \textit{ordinal sum} of the well ordered sets $E$ and $F$. 

There is an easy and worth while way of extending the concept of ordinal sum to infinitely many summands. Suppose that $\{ E_{i} \}$ is a disjoint family of well ordered sets indexed by well ordered set $I$. The ordinal sum of the family is the union $\bigcup_{i}E_{i}$, ordered as follows. If $a$ and $b$ are elements of the union, with $a \in E_{i}$ and $b \in E_{j}$, then $a < b$ means that either $i < j$ or else $i =j$ and $a$ precedes $b$ in the given order of $E_{i}$. 

The definition of addition for ordinal numbers is now child's play. For each well ordered set $X$, let ord $X$ be the unique ordinal number similar to $X$. (If $X$ is finite, then ord $X$ is the same as the natural number $#(X)$ defined earlier.) If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers, let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint well ordered sets with ord $A = \alpha$ and ord $B =  \beta$, and let $C$ be the ordinal sum of $A$ and $B$. The \textit{sum} $ \alpha + \beta$ is, by definition, the ordinal number of $C$, so that ord $A +$ ord $B = $ ord $C$. It is important to note that the sum $\alpha + \beta$ is independent of the particular choice of the sets $A$ and $B$; any other pair of disjoint sets, with the same ordinal numbers, would have given the same result. 

These considerations extend without difficulty to the infinite case. If $\{ \alpha_{i} \}$ is a well ordered family of ordinal numbers indexed by a well ordered set $I$, let $\{ A_{i} \}$ be a disjoint family of well ordered sets with ord $A_{i} = \alpha_{i}$ for each $i$, and let $A$ be the ordinal sum of the family $\{ A_{i} \}$. The sum $\sum_{i \in I} \text{ ord } A_{i}$ is, by definition, the ordinal number of $A$, so that $\sum_{i \in I} \text{ ord } A_{i} = \text{ ord } A$.
