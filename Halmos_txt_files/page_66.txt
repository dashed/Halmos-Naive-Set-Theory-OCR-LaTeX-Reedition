ExERCISE. Use this definition to prove that W is infinite: set can be equivalent to &t most one natural number_ (Proof: we lOw that for any two distinct natural numbers one must be an element d therefore proper subset of the other; it follows from the preceding ragraph that they cannot be equivalent.) We may infer that & finite t is never equivalent to & proper subset; in other words, we ick to finite sets, the whole is always greater than any of its parts: ExERCISE. Use this consequence of the definition of finiteness to prove that w is infinite. Since every subset of & natural number is equivalent to & natural num- I, it followg also that subset of & finite get is finite. The number of elements in finite set E i8, by definition, the unique tural number equivalent to E; we shall denote it by #(E). It is clear at if the correspondence between E and #(E) is restricted to the finite bsets of some set X, the result is & function from & subset of the power P(X) to This function is pleasantly related to the familiar set- eoretic relations operations. Thus for example, if E and are ite gets such that E â‚¬ F, then #(E) < #(F). (The reason is that since #(E) and F ~ #(F), it follows that #(E) is equivalent to & subset of F).) Another example is the assertion that if E and are finite sets en E U F is finite, and_ moreover, if E and F are disjoint, then #(E U F) #(E) + #(F): The crucial step in the proof is the fact that if m and natural number8, then the complement of m in the sum m + n is equiv- ent to n; the proof of this auxiliary fact is achieved by induction on milar techniques prove that if E F are finite sets, then 80 also are XF and EP and, moreover, #(E X F) #(E) . #(F) and  #(EF) E)"(P) . ExERCISE: The union of & finite set of finite sets is finite. If E is finite, then P(E) is finite and, moreover, #(P(E)) 2t(E) . If E is & non-empty finite set of natural numbers, then there exists an element k in E such that &kfor all m in E. Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN long every and and
