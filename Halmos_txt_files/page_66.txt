hypothesis, $n = E - {n}$. This implies that $E = n^{+}$, which contradicts the assumption that $E$ is a proper subset of $n^{+}$. 

A set $E$ is called \text{finite} if it is equivalent to some natural number; otherwise $E$ is \textit{infinite}.

A set can be equivalent to at most one natural number. (Proof: we know that for any two distinct natural numbers one must be an element and therefore proper subset of the other; it follows from the preceding paragraph that they cannot be equivalent.) We may infer that a finite set is never equivalent to a proper subset; in other words, we stick to finite sets, the whole is always greater than any of its parts.

Since every subset of a natural number is equivalent to a natural number, it follows also that every subset of a finite set is finite. 

The \textit{number of elements} in a finite set $E$ is, by definition, the unique natural number equivalent to $E$; we shall denote it by $#(E)$. It is clear that if the correspondence between $E$ and $#(E)$ is restricted to the finite bsets of some set $X$, the result is a function from a subset of the power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ to $\omega$. This function is pleasantly related to the familiar set-theoretic relations and operations. Thus, for example, if $E$ and $F$ are finite sets such that $E subset F$, then $#(E) \le #(F)$. (The reason is that since $E \sim #(E)$ and $F \sim #(F)$, it follows that $#(E)$ is equivalent to a subset of $#(F).) Another example is the assertion that if $E$ and $F$ are finite sets then $E \cup F$ is finite, and, moreover, if $E$ and $F$ are disjoint, then $#(E U F) = #(E) + #(F)$. The crucial step in the proof is the fact that if $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers, then the complement of $m$ in the sum $m + n$ is equivalent to $n$; the proof of this auxiliary fact is achieved by induction on $n$. Similar techniques prove that if $E$ and $F$ are finite sets, then so also are $E \times F$ and $E^{F}$, and, moreover, $#(E \times F) = #(E) \dot #(F)$ and  $#(E^{F}) = #(E)^#(F)$. 

\begin{named}[Exercise. ] The union of a finite set of finite sets is finite. If $E$ is finite, then $\mathcal{P}(E)$ is finite and, moreover, $#(\mathcal{P}(E)) = 2^{#(E)}$. If $E$ is a non-empty finite set of natural numbers, then there exists an element $k$ in $E$ such that $m \le k$ for all $m$ in $E$.
