has & gubset Y equivalent to X. Since each of the disjoint sets X X Y YXX, and Y X Y ig infinite equivalent to X X X, hence to X, and hence to Y, it followg that their union ig equivelent to Y. By combining f with & one- to-one correspondence between that union and Y_ we obtain proper extension of f, in contradiction to the assumed maximality. Thig implies that our present hypothesis (card X card 4) is untenable and hence completes the proof. ExERCISE.
