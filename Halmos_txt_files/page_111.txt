has a subset $Y$ equivalent to $X$. Since each of the disjoint sets $X \times Y$, $Y \times X$, and $Y \times Y$ is infinite and equivalent to $X \times X$, hence to $X$, and hence to $Y$, it follows that their union is equivalent to $Y$. By combining $f$ with a one-to-one correspondence between that union and $Y$, we obtain a proper extension of $f$, in contradiction to the assumed maximality. This implies that our present hypothesis (card $X <$ card $A$) is untenable and hence completes the proof. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE. ] Prove that if $a$ and $b$ are cardinal numbers at least one of which is infinite, then $a + b = ab$. Prove that if $a$ and $b$ are cardinal numbers such that $a$ is infinite and $b$ is finite, then $a^{b} = a$.
