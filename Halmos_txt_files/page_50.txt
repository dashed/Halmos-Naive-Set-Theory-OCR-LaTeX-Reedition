FAMILIES an product guch &8 X is called & function of several variables, and, in par- cular, function on & Cartesian product Xa X Xt is called & function of variables. ExERCISE Prove that (U: 4;) X (U; B;) U;i (A;X B;) , that the same equation holds for intersections (provided that the domains of the families involved are not empty). Prove &lso (with appropriate provisos about empty femilies) that 0:X; C X; C U; X; for each in- dex j and that intersection and union can in fact be characterized the extreme solutiong of these inclusions This means that if X; C Y for each index j, then U: X; C Y, and that U; X; is the only set satisfying this minimality condition; the formulation for intersections is similar Original from e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN and
