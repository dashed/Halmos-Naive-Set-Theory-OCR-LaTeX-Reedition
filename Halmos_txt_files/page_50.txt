product such as $X$ is called a function of \textit{several variables}, and, in particular, a function on a Cartesian product $X_{a} \times X_{b}$ is called a function of two variables. 

\begin{named}[Exercise. ] Prove that $(\bigcup_{i}A_{i}) \times (\bigcup_{j}B_{j}) = \bigcup_{i,j}(A_{i} \times B_{j})$, and that the same equation holds for intersections (provided that the domains of the families involved are not empty). Prove also (with appropriate provisos about empty femilies) that $\bigcap_{i}X_{i} \subset X_{j} \subset \bigcup_{i}X_{i}$ for each index $j$ and that intersection and union can in fact be characterized as the extreme solutions of these inclusions. This means that if $X_{j} \subset Y$ for each index $j$, then $\bigcup_{i}X_{i} \subset Y$, and that $\bigcup_{i}X_{i}$ is the only set satisfying this minimality condition; the formulation for intersections is similar.
