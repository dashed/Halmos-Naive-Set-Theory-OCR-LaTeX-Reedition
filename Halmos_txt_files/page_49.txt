The notation of families is the one normally used in generalizing the concept of Cartesian product. The Cartesian product of two sets $X$ and $Y$ was defined as the set of all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ with $x$ in $X$ and $y$ in $Y$. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between this set and a certain set of families. Consider, indeed, any  particular unordered ppair $\{ a,b \}$, with $a \neq b$, and consider the set $Z$ of all families $z$, indexed by $\{ a,b \}$, such that $ z_{a} \in X$ and $z_{b} \in Y$. If the function $f$ from $Z$ to $X \times Y$ is defined by $f(z) = (z_{a}, z_{b})$, then $f$ is the promised one-to-one correspondence. The difference between $Z$ and $X \times Y$ is merely matter of notation. The generalization of Cartesian products generalizes $Z$ rather than $X \times Y$ itself. (As a consequence there is little terminological friction in the passage from the special case to the general. There is no help for it; that is how mathematical language is in fact used nowadays.) The generalization is now straightforward. If $\{ X_{i} \}$ is a family of sets $(i \in I)$, the \textit{Cartesian product} of the family is, by definition, the set of all families $\{ x_{i} \}$ with $x_{i} \in X_{i}$ for each $i$ in $I$. There are several symbols for the Cartesian product in more or less current usage; in this book we shall denote it by 

\begin{equation*}
\Chi_{i \in I}X_{i} \: \text{ or } \: \Chi_{i}X_{i}.
\end{equation*}

It is clear that if every $X_{i}$ is equal to one and the same set $X$, then $\Chi_{i}X_{i} = X^{I}$. If $I$ is a pair $\{ a,b \}$, with a \neq b, then it is customary to identify $\Chi_{i \in I}X_{i}$ with the Cartesian product $X_{a} \times X_{b}$ as defined earlier, and if $I$ is a singleton $\{ a \}$, the, similarly, we identify $\Chi_{i \in I}X_{i}$ with $X_{a}$ itself. \textit{Ordered triples, ordered quadruples}, etc., may be defined as families whose index sets are unordered triples, quadruples, etc. 

Suppose that $\{ X_{i} \}$ is a family of sets $(i \in I)$ and let $X$ be its Cartesian product. If $J$ is a subset of $I$, then to each element of $X$ there corresponds in a natural way an element of the partial Cartesian product $\Chi_{i \in J}X_{i}$. To define the correspondence, recall that each element $x$ of $X$ is itself a family $\{ x_{i} \}$, that is, in the last analysis, a function on $I$; the corresponding element, say $y$, of $\Chi_{i \in J}X_{i}$ is obtained by simply restricting that function to $J$. Explicitly, we write $y_{i} = x_{i}$ whenever $i \in J$. The correspondence $x \rigtharrow y$ is called the projection from $X$ onto $\Chi_{i \in J}X_{i}$; we shall temporarily denote it by $f_{J}. If, in particular, $J$ is a singleton, say $J = \{ j \}$, then we shall write $f_{j}$ (instead of $f_{j}$) for $f_{J}$. The word "projection" has a multiple use; if $X \in X$, the value of $f_{j}$ at $x$, that is $x_{j}$, is also called the projection of $x$ onto $X_{j}$, or, alternatively, the \textit{j-coordinate} of $x$.
