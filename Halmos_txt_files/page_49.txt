36 NAIVE SET THEORY Sec: Explanation of notation: & gymbol such U;j is an abbreviation for UtnIxj The notation of families is the one normally used in generalizing the concept of Cartesian product The Cartesian product of two gets X and Y was defined as the set of all ordered pairs (€, y) with € in X and y in Y. There is 8 natural one-to-one correspondence between this set and & cer- tain set   of   families_ Consider , indeed, any  particular   unordered {a,6} , with a 7 b, &nd consider the set Z of all families 2, indexed by {a,b}, such that 2 € X and 26 If the function f from Z to X X Y is defined by f(e) (20, 26) , then f i8 the promised one-to-one correspond- ence. The difference between Z end X X Y is merely matter of nota- tion. The generalization of Cartesian products generalizes Z rather than X X Y itself. (As consequence there is little terminological  friction in the passage from the case to the general: There is no help for it; that is how mathematical language is in fact used nowadays) The generalization ig now straightforward. If {X;} is & family of sets (i I) , the Cartesian product of the family i8, by definition, the get of all families Iw;} with I; X; for each i in I. There are several gymbols for the Carte- sian product in more or less current ugage; in this book we ghall denote it by Xia X; or X X; It is clear that if every X; is equal to one &nd the gme set X, then X; X; X'. If [ i8 & {a,b}, with a # b, then it ig customary to identify Xia X; with the Cartesian product Xa X Xb &8 defined earlier, and if [ singleton {a}, similarly , we identify XiaI X; with Xa itself. Ordered triples, ordered quadruples , etc , may be defined families whose index sets are unordered triples, quadruples, etc Suppose that {X;} is & family of sets (i I) and let X be its Cartesian product_ If J is & subset of [, then to each element of X there corresponds na tural way an element of the partial Cartesian product XaJ X; To define the correspondence, recall that each element z of X is itself family {z;}, that is, in the last analysis, & function on I; the corresponding element, say %, of Xiaz X; is obtained by simply restricting that function to J Explicitly, we write y; = %; whenever i€J The correspondence called the projection from X onto Xia X;; we shall temporarily denote it by fj: If, in particular, J is & singleton, say J {j} , then we shall write f; (instead of fAj)) for fj. The word "projection" has & multiple use; if = X, the value of f; at €, that is €j, ig also called the projection of onto Xj O, alternatively, the j-coordinate of € function on Carte - Original fom ed by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN pair special pair then, y i8
