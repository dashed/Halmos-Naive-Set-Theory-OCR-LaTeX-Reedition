SECTION 13 ARITHMETIC The introduction of addition for natural numbers is & typical example of definition by induction: Indeed, it follows the recursion theorem that for each natural number there exists function Sm from to such that 8m(0) and such that 8m (n (8m (n)) + every natural number n; the value 8(n) i8, by definition, the sum m + n The general arithmetic properties of addition ere proved by repeated applications of the principle of mathematical induction.   Thus, for instance, addition is associative. Thig meang that (k + m) +n =k + (m + n) whenever k, m, and n ere natural numbers: The proof goes by induction on n &8 follows. Since (k + m) =k+m and k + (m + 0) =k+m, the equation is true if n = 0. If the equation is true for 7, then (k + m) + n ((k+ m) + n)+ (by definition) (k + (m + n)) + (by the in- duction hypothesis) = k + (m + n) + (again by the definition of addition) k+ (m +nt) (ditto), and the argument is complete. The proof that addition is commutative (i.e , m + n for all and n) is & little tricky; & straightforward attack might fail The trick i8 to prove, by in- duction on n, that (i) 0 + n =n and (ii) m + + n (m + n) +, then to prove the desired commutativity equation by induction o m, vie (i) and (ii)_ Similar techniques are in the definitions of products and expo nents and in the derivations of their basic arithmetic properties_ To define multiplication, apply the recursion theorem to produce functions Pm such that Pn (0) 0 and such that Pn (n +) Pm(n) + m for every natural num- ber n; then the value Pn(n) is, by definition, the product m-n (The dot is frequently omitted ) Multiplication is associative and commutative; the 50 Original from e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN from for +0 and applied
