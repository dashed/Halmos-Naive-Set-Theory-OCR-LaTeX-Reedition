\chapter{SECTION 13: ARITHMETIC} 

The introduction of addition for natural numbers is a typical example of definition by induction. Indeed, it follows the recursion theorem that for each natural number there exists a function $s_{m}$ from $|omega$ to $\omega$ such that $s_{m}(0) = m$ and such that $s_{m}(n^{+}) = (s_{m}(n))^{+}$ for every natural number $n$; the value $s_{m}(n)$ is, by definition, the \textit{sum} $m + n$. The general arithmetic properties of addition are proved by repeated applications of the principle of mathematical induction. Thus, for instance, addition is associative. This means that 

\begin{equation*}
(k + m) + n = k + (m + n) 
\end{equation*}

whenever $k$, $m$, and $n$ are natural numbers. The proof goes by induction on $n$ as follows. Since $(k + m) + 0 = k + m$ and $k + (m + 0) = k + m$, the equation is true if $n = 0$. If the equation is true for $n$, then $(k + m) + n^{+} = ((k+ m) + n)^{+}$ (by definition) $ = (k + (m + n))^{+}$ (by the induction hypothesis) $ = k + (m + n)^{+}$ (again by the definition of addition) $ = k + (m + n^{+})$ (ditto), and the argument is complete. The proof that addition is commutative (i.e, $m + n = n+ m$ for all $m$ and $n$) is a little tricky; a straightforward attack might fail. The trick is to prove, by induction on $n$, that (i) $0 + n = n$ and (ii) $m^{+} + n =  (m + n)^{+}$, and then to prove the desired commutativity equation by induction on $m$, via (i) and (ii). 

Similar techniques are in the definitions of products and exponents and in the derivations of their basic arithmetic properties. To define multiplication, apply the recursion theorem to produce functions $p_{m}$ such that $p_{m}(0) = 0$ and such that $p_{m}(n^{+}) = p_{m}(n) + m$ for every natural number $n$; then the value $p_{m}(n)$ is, by definition, the \textit{product} $m \dot n$ (The dot is frequently omitted.) Multiplication is associative and commutative; the
