from $Y$ to $Z$. The composite relation $T$, from $X$ to $Z$, is denoted by $S \circ R$, or, simply, by $SR$; it is defined so that $xTz$ if and only if there exists an element $y$ in $Y$ such that $xRy$ and $ySz$. For an instructive example, let $R$ mean "son" and let $S$ mean "brother" in the set of human males. In other words, $xRy$ means that $x4 is son of $y$, and $ySz$ means that $y$ is a brother of $z$. In this case the composite relation $SR$ means "nephew." (Query: what do $R^{-1}$, $S^{-1}$, $RS$, and $R^{-1}S^{-1}$ mean?) If both $R$ and $S$ are functions, then $xRy$ and $ySz$ can be rewritten as $R(x) = y$ and $S(y) = z$ respectively. It follows that $S(R(x)) = z$ if and only if $xTz$, so that functional composition is indeed a special case of what is sometimes called the \textit{relative product}.

The algebraic properties of inversion and composition are the same for relations as for functions. Thus, in particular, composition is commutative by accident only, but it is always associative, and it is always connected with inversion via the equation (SR)^{-1} = R^{-1}S^{-1}. (Proofs?) 

The algebra of relations provides some amusing formulas.   Suppose that, temporarily, we consider relations in one set $X$ only, and, in particular, let the relation of equality in $X$ (which is the same as the identity mapping on $X$). The relation $I$ acts as s multiplicative unit; this means that $IR = RI = R$ for every relation $R$ in $X$. Query: is there a connection among $I$, $RR^{-1}$, and $R^{-1}R$? The three defining properties of an equivalence relation can be formulated in algebraic terms as follows: reflexivity means $I \subset R$, symmetry means $R \subset R^{-1}$, and transitivity means $RR \subset R$.
