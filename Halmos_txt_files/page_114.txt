valid for all cardinal numbers $a$. Proof: if $A$ is a set with card $A = a$, then $A \prec \mathcal{P}(A)$, hence card $A <$ card $\mathcal{P}(A)$, and therefore $a < 2^{a}$. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE. ] If card $A = a$, what is the cardinal number of the set of all one-to-one mappings of $A$ onto itself? What is the cardinal number of the set of all countably infinite subsets of $A$?

The facts about the ordering of ordinal numbers are at the same time facts about the ordering of cardinal numbers. Thus, for instance, we know that any two cardinal numbers are comparable (always either $a < b$, or $a = b$, or $b < a$), and that, in fact, every set of cardinal numbers is well ordered. We know also that every set of cardinal numbers has an upper bound (in fact, a supremum), and that, moreover, for every set of cardinal numbers, there is a cardinal number strictly greater than any of them. This implies of course that there is no largest cardinal number, or, equivalently, that there is no set that consists exactly of all the cardinal numbers. The contradiction, based on the assumption that there is such a set, is known as \textit{Cantor's paradox}. 

The fact that cardinal numbers are special ordinal numbers simplifies some aspects of the theory, but, at the same time, it introduces the possibility of some confusion that it is essential to avoid. One major source of difficulty is the notation for the arithmetic operations. If $a$ and $b$ are cardinal numbers, then they are also ordinal numbers, and, consequently, the sum $a + b$ has two possible meanings. The cardinal sum of two cardinal numbers is in general not the same as their ordinal sum. All this sounds worse than it is; in practice it is easy to avoid confusion. The context, the use of special symbols for cardinal numbers, and an occasional explicit warning can make the discussion flow quite smoothly. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE. ] Prove that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers, then card $(\alpha + \beta ) =$ card $\alpha +$ and card $\beta$ and card $(\alpha \beta) =$ (card $\alpha$)(card $\beta$). Use the ordinal interpretation of the operations on the left side and the cardinal interpretation on the right.

One of the special symbols for cardinal numbers that is used very frequently is the first letter $(\aleph, aleph)$ of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus in particular the smallest transfinite ordinal number, i.e., $\omega$, is a cardinal number, and, as such, it is always denoted by $\aleph_{0}$.

Every one of the ordinal numbers that we have explicitly named so far is countable. In many of the applications of set theory an important role is played by the smallest uncountable ordinal number, frequently denoted by $\Omega$. The most important property of $\omega$ is that it is an infinite well ordered
