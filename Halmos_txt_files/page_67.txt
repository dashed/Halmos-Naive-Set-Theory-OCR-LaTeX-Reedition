\chapter{SECTION 14: ORDER}

Throughout mathematics, and, in perticular, for the generalization to infinite sets of the counting process appropriate to finite sets, the theory of order plays an important role. The basic definitions are simple. The only thing to remember is that the primary motivation comes from the familiar properties of "less than or equal to" and not "less than." There is no profound reason for this; it just happens that the generalization of "less than or equal to" occurs more frequently and is more amenable to algebraic treatment. 

A relation $R$ in a set $X$ is called \textit{antisymmetric} if, for every $x$ and $y$ in $X$, the simultaneous validity of $xRy$ and $yRx$ implies that $x = y$. A \textit{partial order} (or sometimes simply an \textit{order}) in a set $X$ is a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive relation in $X$. It is customary to use only one symbol (or some typographically close relative of it) for most partial orders in most sets; the symbol in common use is the familiar inequality sign. Thus a partial order in $X$ may be defined as a relation $\le$ in $X$ such that, for all $x$, $y$, and $z$ in $X$, we have (i) $x le x$, (ii) if $x \le y$ and $y \le x$, then $x = y$, and (iii) if $x \le y$ and $y \le \$, then $x \le z$. The reason for the qualifying "partial" is that some questions about order may be left unanswered. If for every $x$ and $y$ in $X$ either $x \le y$ or $y \le x$, then $\le$ is called a \textit{total} (sometimes also \textit{simple} or \textit{linear}) order. A totally ordered set is frequently called a \textit{chain}.

The most natural example of a partial (and not total) order is inclusion. Explicitly: for each set $X$, the relation $\subset$ is a partial order in the power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$; it is a total order if and only if $X$ is empty or $X$ is a singleton. A
