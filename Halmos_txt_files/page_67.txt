SECTION 14 ORDER Throughout mathematics, and, in perticular, for the generalization to infinite gets of the counting process appropriate to finite set8, the of order playg an important role. The basic definitiong are gimple The only to remember i8 that the primary motivetion comes from the familiar properties of 'less than Or equal to" and not "less than There is no profound reason for this; it just happens that the generalization of "less than equel to" occur8 more frequently and is more amenable to algebraic treatment_ A relation R in & get X is called antisymmetric if, for every € and y in X, the simultaneous validity of z R y implies that = partial order (or gometimeg gimply an order) in & set X is & redexive, antisymmetric, and trangitive relation in X It is customary to use only one gymbol (or some typographically close reletive of it) for most partial orders in most sets; the symbol in common uge i8 the familier inequality sign. Thus partial order in X be defined &8 & relation & in X guch that, for all €, Y, and in X, we have (i) = < %, (ii) if z & y and y & %, then > (ii) if z & y and y < 2, then € & 2 The reason for the qualifying "par- tial" is that gome questiong about order may be left unanswered: If for every and y in X either € & y O y & %, then & ig called total (gome- times   also simple linear)  order: A totally  ordered 8et i8 frequently called & chain. ExERCISE. Express the conditiong of antisymmetry end totality for relation R by means of equetions involving R and its inverse_ The most natural example of & partial (and not total) order ig inclusion. Explicitly : for each set X, the relation C is & partiel order in the power set P(X); it is & total order if and oly if X is empty or X i8 & Bingleton.
