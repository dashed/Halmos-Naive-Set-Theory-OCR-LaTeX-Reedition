infinite subset of $A$, then $X \times 2 sim X$. This implies that the collection $\mathcal{F}$ is not empty; at the very least it contains the one-to-one correspondences between $X \times 2$ and $X$ for the countably infinite subsets $X$ of $A$. The collection $\mathcal{F}$ is partially ordered by extension. Since a straightforward verification shows that the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are satisfied, it follows that $\mathcal{F}$ contains a maximal element $f$ with ran $f = X$, say. 

Assertion: $A - X$ is finite. If $A - X$ were infinite, then it would include a countably infinite set, say $Y$. By combining $f$ with a one-to-one correspondence between $Y \times 2$ and $Y$ we could obtain a proper extension $f$, in contradiction to the assumed maximality. 

Since card $X +$ card $X =$ card $X$, and since card $A = $ card $X +$ card $(A - X)$, the fact that $A - X$ is finite completes the proof that card $A +$ card $A$ = card $A$.

Here is one more result in additive cardinal arithmetic: if $a$ and $b$ are cardinal numbers at least one of which is infinite, and if $c$ is equal to the larger one of $a$ and $b$, then 

\begin{equation*}
a + b = c
\end{equation*}

Suppose that $b$ is infinite, and let $A$ and $B$ be disjoint sets with card $A = a$ and card $B = b$. Since $a \le c$ and $b \le c$, it follows that $a + b \le c + c$, and since $c \le$ card ($A \cup B$), it follows that $c \le a + b$. The result follows from the antisymmetry of the ordering of cardinal numbers. 

The principal result in multiplicative cardinal arithmetic is that if $a$ is an infinite cardinal number, then 

\begin{equation*}
a \cdot a = a. 
\end{equation *}

The proof resembles the proof of the corresponding additive fact. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the collection of all functions $f$ such that the domain of $f$ is of the form $X \times X$ for some subset $X$ of $A$, and such that $f$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $X \times X$ and $X$. If $X$ is a countably infinite subset of $A$, then $X \times X \sim X$ .This implies that the collection $\mathcal{F}$ is not empty; at the very least it contains the one-to-one correspondences between $X \times X$ and $X$ for the countably infinite subsets $X$ of $A$. The collection $\mathcal{F}$ is partially ordered by extension. The hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are easily verified, and it follows that $\mathcal{F}$ contains a maximal element $f$ with ran $f = X$, say. Since (card $X$)(card $X) =$ card $X$, the proof may be completed by showing that card $X =$ card $A$. 

Assume that card $X <$ card $A$. Since card $A$ is equal to the larger one of card $X$ and card ($A - X$), this implies that card $A =$ card ($A - X$), and hence that card $X <$ card ($A - X$. From this it follows that $A - X$
