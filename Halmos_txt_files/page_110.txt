24 CARDINAL ARITHMETIC ly infinite gubset of 4, then X X 2 ~ X_ This implieg that the collec- J is not empty; at the very least it contains the one-to-one corre- ondences between X X 2 and X for the countably infinite subsets X of The collection 9 is partially ordered by extension. Since straight- ward verification showg that the hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are gatis- d,it follows that $ contains & maximal element f with ran f X say Assertion: X j8 finite. If A X were infinite, then it would in- de & countably infinite set, say Y. By combining with one-to-one rrespondence between YX 2 and Y we could obtain & proper extension f,in contradiction to the assumed maximality_ Since cerd X + card X card X, and since card A card X + rd (A X), the fact that A X is finite completes the proof that rd A + card A card A. Here is one more result in additive cardinal arithmetic: if and are "dinal numbers at least one of which is infinite, and if â‚¬ is equal to the ger one of a and b, then a +6 = c ppose that b is infinite, and let A and B be disjoint sets with card A =a card B Since and b < C, it follows that a + b 4 +c d since 4 card (A U B), it follows that c & a + b. The result fol- from the antisymmetry of the ordering of cardinal numbers The principal result in multiplicative cardinal arithmetic is that if a is infinite cardinal number, then a.a = @. proof resembles the proof of the corresponding additive fact_ Let $ the collection of all functions such that the domain of f is 0f the form X X for some subset X of 4, and such that f is & one-to-one correspond- ce between X X X and X. If X is countably infinite subset of 4 n XxX~X This implies that the collection $ is not empty; at the y least it contains the one-to-one correspondences between X X X and for the countably infinite subsets X of A. The collection $ is partially lered by extension. The hypotheses of Zorn's lemma are easily verified, d it follows that $ contains maximal element f with ran f X say_ Ice (card X)(card X) card X, the proof may be completed by showing t card X card A Assume that card X card A_ Since cerd A is equal to the larger one card X and card (A X), this implies that card A card (A X) d hence that card X card (A X): From this it follows that A CX Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
