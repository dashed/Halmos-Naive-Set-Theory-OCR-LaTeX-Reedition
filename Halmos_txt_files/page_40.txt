of $\mathcal{R} $ is an ordered pair; this meens, of course, that if $z in \mathcal{R} $, then there exist $x$ and $y$ so that $z = (x,y)$. If $\mathcal{R} $ is relation, it is sometimes convenient to express the fact that $(x, y) \in \mathcal{R} $ by writing 

\begin{equation*}
x \mathcal{R}  y
\end{equation*}

and saying, as in everyday language, that $x$ stands in the reletion $\mathcal{R} $ to $y$. 

The least exciting relation is the empty one. (To prove that $ \emptyset $ is a set ordered pairs, look for an element of $ \emptyset $ that is not an ordered pair.) Another dull example is the Cartesian product of any two sets $X$ and $Y$. Here is a slightly more interesting example: let $X$ be any set, and let $\mathcal{R} $ be the set of all those pairs $(x, y)$ in $X \times X$ for which x = y. The relation $\mathcal{R} $ is just the relation of equality between elements of $X$; if $x$ and $y$ are in $X$, then $x \mathcal{R} y$ means the same as $x = y$. One more example will suffce for now: let $X$ be any set, and let $\mathcal{R} $ be the set of all those pairs $(x, A)$ in $X \times \mathcal{P} (X)$ for which $x \in A$. This relation $\mathcal{R} $ is just the relation of belonging between elements of $X$ and subsets of $X$; if $x \in X$ and $A \in \mathcal{P}(X)$, then $x \mathcal{R} A$ means the same as $x \in A$. 

In the preceding section we saw that associated with every set $\mathcal{R}$ of ordered pairs there are two sets called the projections of $\mathcal{R}$ onto the first and second coordinates. In the theory of relations these sets are known as the \textit{domain} and the \textit{range} of $\mathcal{R}$  (abbreviated dom $\mathcal{R}$ and ran $\mathcal{R}$); we recall that they are defined by 

\begin{equation*}
\text{dom } \mathcal{R} = \{ x: \text{ \texit{for some} } y (x \mathcal{R} y) \}

and

\begin{equation*}
\text{ran } \mathcal{R} = \{ y: \text{ \texit{for some} } x (x \mathcal{R} y) \}.

If $\mathcal{R}$ is the relation of marriage, so that $x \mathcal{R} y$ means that $x$ is a man, $y$ is a woman, and $x$ and $y$ are married to one another; then dom $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of married men and ran $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of married womem. Both the domain and the range of $\emptyset$ are to $\emptyset$. If $\mathcal{R} = X \times Y$, then dom $ \mathcal{R} = X$ and ran $\mathcal{R} = Y$. If $\mathcal{R}$ is equality in $X$, then dom $\mathcal{R} =$ ran $\mathcal{R} = X$. If $\mathcal{R}$ is belonging, between $X$ and $\mathcal{P}(X)$, then dom $\mathcal{R} = X$ and ran $R = \mathcal{P}(X) - \{ \emptyset \}$. 

If $\mathcal{R}$ is a relation included in a Cartesian product $X \times Y$ (so that dom $\mathcal{R} \subset X$ and ran $\mathcal{R} \subset Y$), it is sometimes convenient to say that $\mathcal{R}$ is a relation \textit{from} $X$ \textixt{to} $Y$; instead of a relation from $X$ to $X$ we may speek of a relation \textit{in} $X$. A relation $\mathcal{R}$ in $X$ is \textit{reflexive} if $x \mathcal{R} x$ for every $x$ in $X$; it is \textit{symmetric} if $ x \mathcal{R} y$ implies that $y \mathcal{R} x$; and it is \textit{transitive} if $x \mathcal{R} y$ and $y \mathcal{R} z$ imply that $x \mathcal{R} z$. (Exercise: for each of these three possible properties, find a relation that does not have that property but does have the other two.) A relation
