find a reasonable interpretation of the notation in which these generalizations were here expressed and then prove them. Further  elementary facts: 

\begin{equation*}
\bigcap_{X \in \mathcal{P} (E)} X = \emptyset ,
\end{equation*}

and 

\begin{equation*}
if /: E \subset F , /: then /: \mathcal{P} (E) \subset \mathcal{P} (F).
\end{equation*}

A curious question concerns the commutativity of the operators $ \mathcal{P} $ and $ \bigcup $. Show that $E$ is always equal $\bigcup_{X \in \mathcal{P} (E)} X $ (that is $ E = \bigcup \mathcal{P} (E) $), but that the result of applying $\mathcal{P} $ and $ \bigcup $ to $E$ in the other order is a set that includes $E$ as a subset, typically a proper subset.
