\chapter{SECTION 21: ORDINAL ARITHMETIC} 

For natural numbers we used the recursion theorem to define the arithmetic operations, and, subsequently, we proved that those operations are related to the operations of set in various desirable ways. Thus, instance, we know that the number of elements in the union of two disjoint finite sets $E$ and $F$ is equal to $#(E) + #(F)$. We observe now that fact could have been used to define addition. If $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers, we could have defined their sum by finding disjoint sets $E$ and $F$, with $#(E) = m$ and 4#(F) = n$, and writing $m+ n #(E U F)$.

Corresponding to what was done and to what could have been done for natural numbers, there are two standard approaches to ordinal arithmetic. Partly for the sake of variety, and partly because in this context recursion seems less natural, we shall emphasize the set-theoretic approach instead of the recursive one. 

We begin by pointing out that there is a more or less obvious way of putting two well ordered sets together to form a new well  ordered set. Informally speaking, the idea is to write down one of them and then to follow it by the other. If we try to say this rigorously, we immediately encounter the difficulty that the two sets may not be disjoint. When are we supposed to write down an element that is common to the two sets? The way out of the difficulty is to make the sets disjoint. This can be done by painting their elements different colors. In more mathematical language, replace the elements of the sets by those same elements taken together with some distinguishing object, using two different objects for the two sets. In completely mathematical language: if $E$ and $F$ are arbitrary, let $\hat{E}$ be the aet of all ordered pairs $(x, 0)$ with $x$ in $E$, and let $\hat{F}$ be the set of all ordered pairs $(x,1)$ with $x$ in $F$. The sets $\hat{E}$ and $\hat{F}$ are clearly disjoint. There is an obvious one-to-one correspondence between $E$ and $\hat{E}$ $(x \rightarrow (x,0))$ and another one between $F$ and $\hat{F}$ $(x \rightaeeow (x,1))$.
