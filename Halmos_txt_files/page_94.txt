SECTION 21 ORDINAL ARITHMETIC Cor natural numbers we used the recursion theorem to define the arith- tic operation8, and, gubsequently, we proved that those operations are ted to the operations of set in various desirable ways. Thus, instance, we know that the number of elements in the union of two oint finite sets E and F is equal to #(E) + #(F): We observe now that fact could have been used to define addition. If m and n are natural nbers, we could have defined their sum by finding disjoint sets E and F h #(E) and #(F) =m and writing m + n #(E U F): Corresponding to what was done &nd to what could have been done for ural num there are two gtandard approaches to ordinal arithmetic_ tly for the gake of variety, &nd partly because in this context recursion mg legs natural, we shall emphasize the set-theoretic approach instead he recursive one_ Ve begin by pointing out that there is more Or less obvioug way of ting two well ordered gets together to form new   well  ordered set_ ormally speaking, the idee is to write down one of them and then to OW it by the other: If we try to gy this rigorously, we immediately ounter the diffculty that the two sets may not be disjoint. When are supposed to write down an element that jg common to the two sets? way out of the difficulty is to make the sets disjoint_ This can be 1e by painting their elements different colors. In more mathematical guage, replace the elements of the sets by those same elements taken ether with 8ome distinguishing object, two different objects for two sets_ In completely mathematical language: if E ere arbi- ry let E be the get of all ordered pairs (z, 0) with â‚¬ in E, and let @ the get of &ll ordered (1,1) with & in F. The sets E and F are arly disjoint. There i9 an obvious one-to-one correspondence between and E (> (1,0)) and another one between F and (1 (c,1)). 81 Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN theory bers, using and Bets, pairg
