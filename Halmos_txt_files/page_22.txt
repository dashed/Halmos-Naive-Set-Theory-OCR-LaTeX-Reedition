UNORDEfED Ffino The get theory developed g0 far i8 still & pretty poor for &ll we Ow there is only one get and that one is empty Are there enough sets engure that every get is an element of gome set? I8 it true that for any sets there is & third oe that they both belong to? What about three four; O any number? We need & new principle of get construction resolve such questions The following principle is & good beginning Ixiom of pairing: For any two sets there exists a set that they both be- ong to. te that this is just the affirmative answer to the gecond question above Co reassure worriers, let us hasten to observe that words guch as "two,' ree, and "four; used above; do not refer to the mathematical concepts ring those names, which will be defined later; at present such words are rely the ordinary linguistic abbreviations for "gomething and then some- ng else" repeated an appropriate number of times Thug, for instance, axiom of pairing, in unabbreviated form, say8 that if a and b are sets, n there exists A such that & € A and b € A. Jne congequence (in fact an equivalent formulation) of the axiom of ring is that for any two sets there exists & set that contains both of and nothing else. Indeed, if and b are and if A is get such t a € A and 4, then we can apply the axiom of specificetion to h the sentence @ 0T I =6," The result is the set {c € A:I = @ 0r * = 6} , 1 that get, clearly, contains just and b. The exiom of extension im- s that there can be only one set with this property. The usual symbol that set i8 {a, 6} ; Bet i8 called the (or, by way of emphatic comparigon with sub- uent concept; the unordered pair) formed by and b. f, temporarily, we refer to the sentence "1 a 0r I 6" as S() , we y express the axiom of pairing by saying that there exists & get B guch I € B if and only if S(z). axiom of specification, applied to & set 4, asserts the existence of & B such that I B if and only if (z € A and S(z)).
