21 ORDINAL ARMTHMEMC 83 ord A_ Here too the final result is independent of the arbitrery choice he well ordered 8ets A;; any other choices (with the game ordinal num- 9) would have given the game gum. ome of the properties of addition for ordinal numbers gre good and erg are bad. On the side of the ledger are the identities a + 0 =0 0 + & = &, a +1= at, the associative law a + (8 + ~) = (a + 8) + Y Jally laudable ig the fact that & < and only if there exists an ordinal nber Y different 0 guch thet 8 =0+Y The proofs of &ll these ertiong are elementary. lmost all the bad behavior of addition stems the failure of the mutative law. Sample: 1 + (but, 88 we saw just above, w): The  misbehavior of  addition expresses bome intuitively   clear ts about order: If, for instance, we tack new element in front of an nite sequence (of type @), the result is clearly similer to what we started h; but if we tack it on at the end instead, then we bave ruined 8imilar- the old set had no last element but the new get hag one. The main use of infinite sums i8 to motivate and facilitate the study of ducts: A &nd B are well ordered sets, it is natural to define their duct &8 the result of adding A to itself B times_ To make sense out his, we must first of all manufacture & disjoint family of well ordered each of which is similar to 4, indexed by the set B. The general pre- ption for doing this works well here; all we need to do is to write Ab {6} for each b in B If now we examine the definition of ordinal sum a8 pplies to the family {Ab}, we gre led to formulate the following defini- The ordinal product of two well ordered sets A and B is the Cartesian duct A X B with the reverse lexicographic order: In other words, if 6) &nd (C, d) are in 4 X B, then (a, 6) < (C, d) means that either b < d else b < C. and 8 are ordinal numbers, let A and B be well ordered gets with ord B = 8, and let C be the ordinal product of product a8 by   definition, the ordinal number of C, that d A)(ord B) ord C. The product is unambiguously  defined, inde- dently of the erbitrary choice of the well ordered sets A and B.
