Here too the final result is independent of the arbitrary choice of the well ordered sets $A_{i}$; any other choices (with the same ordinal numbers) would have given the same sum. 

Some of the properties of addition for ordinal numbers are good and others are bad. On the good side of the ledger are the identities 

\begin{allign}
\alpha + 0 &= \alpha , 
0 + \alpha &= \alpha , 
\alpha + 1 &= \alpha^{+} ,
\end{allign}

and the associative law 

\begin{equation*}
\alpha + (\beta + \gamma) = (\alpha + \beta) + \gamma .
\end{equation*}

Equally laudable is the fact that $\alpha < \beta$ if and only if there exists an ordinal number $\gamma$ different from $0$ such that $\beta =  \alpha + \gamma$. The proofs of all these assertions are elementary. 

Almost all the bad behavior of addition stems from the failure of the commutative law. Sample: $1 + \omega = \omega$ (but, as we saw just above, $\omega + 1 \neq \omega$). The misbehavior of addition expresses some intuitively clear facts about order. If, for instance, we tack a new element in front of an infinite sequence (of type $\omega$), the result is clearly similer to what we started with; but if we tack it on at the end instead, then we have ruined similarity; the old set had no last element but the new set has one. 

The main use of infinite sums is to motivate and facilitate the study of products. If $A$ and $B$ are well ordered sets, it is natural to define their product as the result of adding $A$ to itself $B$ times. To make sense out of this, we must first of all manufacture a disjoint family of well ordered sets, each of which is similar to $A$, indexed by the set $B$. The general prescription for doing this works well here; all we need to do is to write $A_{b} = A \times \{  b \}$ for each $b$ in $B$. If now we examine the definition of ordinal sum as it applies to the family $\{ A_{b} \}$, we are led to formulate the following definition. The \textit{ordinal product} of two well ordered sets $A$ and $B$ is the Cartesian product $A \times B$ with the reverse lexicographic order. In other words, if $(a,b)$ and $(c, d)$ are in $A \times B$, then $(a, b) < (c, d)$ means that either $b < d$ or else $b = d$ and $a < c$. 

If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers, let $A$ and $B$ be well ordered sets with ord $A = \alpha$, and ord $B = \beta$, and let $C$ be the ordinal product of $A$ and $B$. The product $\alpha \beta$ is, by definition, the ordinal number of $C$, so that (ord $A$)(ord $B$) = ord $C$. The product is unambiguously  defined, independently of the arbitrary choice of the well ordered sets $A$ and $B$. Alternatively , at this point we could have avoided any arbitrariness at all by
