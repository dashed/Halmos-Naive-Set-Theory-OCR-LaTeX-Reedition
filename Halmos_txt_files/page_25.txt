\chapter*{SECTION 4: UNIONS AND INTERSECTIONS}

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, it is sometimes natural to wish to unite their elements into one comprehensive set. One way of describing such a comprehensive set is to require it to contain all the elements that belong to at least one of the two members of the pair $ \{ A, B \}$. This formulation suggests a sweeping  generalization of itself; surely a similar construction should apply to arbitrary collections of sets and not just to pairs of them. What is wanted, in other words, is the following principle of set construction.

\begin{named}[Axiom of unions. ]  For every collection of sets there exists a set that contains all the elements that belong to at least one set of the given collection.
\end{named}

Here it is again: for every collection $\mathcal{C}$ there exists a set $U$ such that if $x \in X$ for some $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$, then $ x \in U$. (Note that "at least one" is the same as "some.") 

The comprehensive set $U$ described above may be too comprehensive; it may contain elements that belong to none of the sets $X$ in the collection $\mathcal{C}$. This is easy to remedy; just apply the axiom of specification to form the set 

\begin{equation*}
\{ x \in U: x \in X \text{ \textit{for some} } X \text{ \textit{in} } \mathcal{C} \}.
\end{equation*}

The condition here is a translation into idiomatic usage of the mathematically more acceptable "\textit{for some} $X(x \in X \text{ \textit{and} } X \in \mathcal{C})$.") It follows that, for every $x$, a necessary and sufficient condition that $x$ belong to this set is that $x$ belong to $X$ for some $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$. If we change notation and call the new set $U$ again, then

\begin{equation*}
U = {x: x \in X \text{ \textit{ for some } } X \text{ \textit{in} }
\end{equation*} \mathcal{C} \}.

This set $U$ is called the \textit{union} of the collection $\mathcal{C}$ of sets; note that the
