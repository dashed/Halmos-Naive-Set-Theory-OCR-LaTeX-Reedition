SECTION UNIONS AND INTERSECTIONS If A &nd B are gets, it is gometimes natural to wish to unite their ele- ments into one comprehensive set. One way of describing guch com- prehensive set ig to require it to contain all the elements thet to at least one of the two members of the pair (A, B}. Thig formulation sug- gests 8  sweeping  generalization  of itself; surely imilar  construction should apply to arbitrary collections of sets and not just to pairg of them What is wanted; in other words, is the following principle of get construc- tion. Axiom of uniong: For every collection of sets there exists a set that con- tains all the elements that belong to at least one set of the given collection_ Here it ig for collection @ there exists set U such that if I € X for gome X in @, then € U. (Note that "at least one" is the same a8 " gome ) The comprehensive get U described above may be too comprehensive; it may contain elements that to none of the sets X in the collection @. This is easy to remedy; just apply the axiom of specification to form the Bet {z U:reX for some X in @}_ (The condition here ig & translation into idiomatic usage of the mathemati- cally more acceptable "for some X (€ Xand X € @).") It followg that, for every a necessary and gufficient condition that belong to this set is that-z belong to X for gme X in @. If we ~change notation and call the new set U again, then U = Ir:r Xfor sme X in @}. This set U ig called the union of the collection @ of gets; note that tne 12 Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN belong ~again: every belong
