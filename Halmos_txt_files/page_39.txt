SECTION RELATIONS Using ordered pairs, we can formulate the mathematical theory of rela- tions in set-theoretic language. By a relation we mean here something like marriage (between men and women ) belonging (between elements and sets)  More explicitly, what we shall call relation is gometimes called binary relation. An example of a ternary relation is parenthood for people (Adam and Eve are the parents of Cain). In this book we ghall have no occasion to treat the theory of relations that are ternary, quaternary, worge. Looking at any specific relation, such &8 marriage for instance, we might be tempted to consider certain ordered (1,y) , namely just those for which x is man, y ig & woman, and € is married to y. We have not yet seen the definition of the general concept of & relation, but it seems plausi- ble that, just in this marriage example; every relation should uniquely determine the set of all those ordered for which the first coordinate does stand in that relation to the gecond. If we know the relation, we know the get, and, better yet, if we know the set, we know the relation. If, instance, we were presented with the set of ordered pairs of people that corresponds to marriage, then, even if we forgot the definition of marriage, we could elways tell when man € is married to & woman y and when not we would just have to see whether the ordered (1,y) does or does not belong to the We may not know what & relation is, but we do know what & get is, and the preceding considerations establish & close connection between relations and sets_ The precise set-theoretic treatment of relations takes advantage of that heuristic connection; the simplest to do is to define & relation to be the corresponding set_ This is what we do; we bereby define & rela- tion a8 & set of ordered pairs: Explicitly: & get R i8 & relation if each ele 26 Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN pairs peirs for pair set. thing
