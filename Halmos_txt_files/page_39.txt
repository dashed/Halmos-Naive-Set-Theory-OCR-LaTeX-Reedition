\chapter{SECTION 7 RELATIONS}

Using ordered pairs, we can formulate the mathematical theory of relations in set-theoretic language. By a relation we mean here something like marriage (between men and women) belonging (between elements and sets).  More explicitly, what we shall call a relation is sometimes called a \textit{binary} relation. An example of a ternary relation is parenthood for people (Adam and Eve are the parents of Cain). In this book we shall have no occasion to treat the theory of relations that are ternary, quaternary, or worse. 

Looking at any specific relation, such as marriage for instance, we might be tempted to consider certain ordered pairs $(x,y)$, namely just those for which $x$ is man, $y$ is a woman, and $x$ is married to $y$. We have not yet seen the definition of the general concept of a relation, but it seems plausible that, just as in this marriage example, every relation should uniquely determine the set of all those ordered for which the first coordinate does stand in that relation to the second. If we know the relation, we know the set, and, better yet, if we know the set, we know the relation. If, for instance, we were presented with the set of ordered pairs of people that corresponds to marriage, then, even if we forgot the definition of marriage, we could always tell when a man $x$ is married to a woman $y$ and when not; we would just have to see whether the ordered pair $(x,y)$ does or does not belong to the set.

We may not know what a relation is, but we do know what a set is, and the preceding considerations establish a close connection between relations and sets. The precise set-theoretic treatment of relations takes advantage of that heuristic connection; the simplest to do is to define a relation to be the corresponding set. This is what we do; we hereby define a textit{relation} as a set of ordered pairs. Explicitly: a set $R$ is a relation if each element
