The word ass' is also used in this context, but there is & slight danger in doing s0. e reason is that in some approaches to set theory class" has & hnical meaning: We shall have occasion to refer to this again & little Jne that the development will not include is & definition of gets. situation is analogous to the familiar axiomatic approach to elemen- y geometry_ That approach does not offer & definition of points &nd ingtead it describes what it is that one can do with those objects e gemi-axiomatic point of view adopted here assumes that the reader the ordinary, human, intuitive (and frequently erroneous) understand- of what sets are; the purpose of the exposition is to delineete gme of many things that oe can correctly do with them. Sets, 28 they are   usually  conceived, have  elements or  members. An ment of 8 set may be & wolf, & grape, Or & pigeon. It is important to ow that & set itself may also be an element of some other set_ Mathemat- is full of examples of sets of sets. A line, for instance; is a set of points; set of all lines in the plane is & natural example of & set of sets (of points). at may be surprising is not 80 much that sets may occur elements, t that for mathematical purposes no other elements need ever be con- ered_ In this book, in particular, we shall study and sets of sets, d similar towers of sometimes frightening height and complexity -and else.
