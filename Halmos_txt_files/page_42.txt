that stand in the relation $\mathcal{R}$ to one another. This proves the first half of our assertion. 

The second half is easier. Start partition $\mathcal{C}$ and consider the induced relation. Since element of $X$ belongs to some set of $\mathcal{C}$, reflexivity just says that $x$ and $y$ are in the same set of $\mathcal{C}$. Symmetry says that if $x$ and $y$ are in the same set of $\mathcal{C}$, then $y$ and $x$ are in the same set of $\mathcal{C}$, and this is obviously true.  Transitivity says that if $x$ and $y$ are in the same set of $\mathcal{C}$ and if $y$ and $z$ are in the same set of $\mathcal{C}$, then $x$ and $z$ are in the same set of $\mathcal{C}$, and this too is obvious. The equivalence class of each $x$ in $X$ is just the of $\mathcal{C}$ to which $x$ belongs. This completes the proof of everything that was promised.
