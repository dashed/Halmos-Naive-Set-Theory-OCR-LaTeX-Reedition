c. T RELATIONS 29 n, that stand in the relation R to one another: This proves the st half of our assertion: The second half is easier Start partition @ and consider the luced relation. Since element of X belongs to some set of @, re- xivity just say8 that € and € are in the same get of Symmetry says at if z and y are in the same set of @, then y and z are in the same get of and this is obviously true.  Transitivity says that if € and y are in the me set of @ and if y and 2 are in the same set of @, then € and 2 are in the me set of @, and this too is obvious: The equivalence class of each x in is just the of @ to which z belongs This completes the of every- ing that wes promised Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN they with every proof set .
