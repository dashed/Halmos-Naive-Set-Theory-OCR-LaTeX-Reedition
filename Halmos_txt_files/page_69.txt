and (ii) if $x < y$ and $y < z$ then $x < z$ (i.e., $<$ is transitive). If, conversely, $<$ is a relation in $X$ satisfying (i) and (ii), and if $x \le y$ is defined to mean that either $x < y$ or $x = y$, then $\le$ is a partial order in $X$. 

The connection between $\le$ and $<$ can be generalized to arbitrary relations. That is, given any relation $R$ in a set $X$, we can define a relation $S$ in $X$ by writing $xSy$ in case $xRy$ but $x \neq y$, and, vice versa, given any relation $S$ in $X$, we can define a relation $R$ in $X$ by writing $xRy$ in case either $xSy$ or $x = y$. To have an abbreviated way of referring to the passage from $R$ to $S$ and back we shall say that $S$ is the \textit{strict} relation corresponding to $R$, and $R$ is the \textit{weak} relation corresponding to $S$. We shall say of a relation in a set $X$ that it "partially orders $X$" in case either it is a partial order in $X$ or else the corresponding weak relation is one.

If $X$ is a partially ordered set, and if $a \in X$, the set $\{ x \in X:x < a \}$ is the \textit{initial segment} determined by $a$; we shall usually denote it by $s(a)$. The set $\{ x \in X: x \le a \}$ is the \texit{weak initial segment} determined by $a$, and will be denoted by $\tilde{s}(a). When it is important to emphasize the distinction between initial segments and weak initial segments, the former will be called \textit{strict} initial segments. In general the words "strict" and "weak" refer to $<$ and $\le$ respectively. Thus, for instance, the initial segment determined by $a$ may be described as the set of all predecessors of $a$, or, for emphasis, as the set of all \textit{strict predecessors} of $a$; similarly the weak initial segment determined by $a$ consists of all \textit{weak predecessors} of $a$. If $x \le y$ and $y \le z$, we may say that $y$ is \textit{between} $x$ and $z$; if $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $y$ is \textit{strictly between} $x$ and $z$. If $x < y$ if there is no element strictly between $x$ and $y$, we say that $x$ is an \textit{immediate predecessor} of $y$, or $y4 is an \textit{immediate successor} of $x$. 

If $X$ is a partially ordered set (which may in particular be totally ordered), then it could happen that $X$ has an element $a$ such that $a \le x$ for every $x$ in $X$. In that case wesgay that $a$ is the \textit{least} (\textit{smallest, first}) element of $X$. The antisymmetry of an order implies that if $X$ has a least element, then it has only one. If, similarly, $X$ has an element $a$ such that $x \le a$ for every $x$ in $X$, then $a$ is the \textit{greatest} ( \textit{largest, last} ) element of $X$; it too is unique (if it exists at all). The set $\omega$ of all natural numbers (with its customary ordering by magnitude) is an example of a partially ordered set with a first element (namely $0$) but no last. The same set, but this time with the inverse ordering, has a last element but no first. 

In partially ordered sets there is an important distinction between least elements and minimal ones. If, as before, $X$ is a partially ordered set, an element $a$ of $X$ is called a \textit{minimal} element of $X$ in case there is no element in $X$ strictly smaller than $a$. Equivalently, $a$ is minimal if $x \le a$ implies
