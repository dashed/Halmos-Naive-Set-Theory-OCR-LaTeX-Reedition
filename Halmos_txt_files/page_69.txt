The connection between < and can be generalized to arbitrary rela- tions That is, given any relation R in & set X, we can define & relation $ in X by writing z 8 y in case c R y but € # y, and, vice versa, given any relation S in X, we can define relation R in X by writing z R y in case either I S y Or I =y: To have an abbreviated way of referring to the passage from R to $ and back we shall say that S is the strict relation corresponding to R, and R is the weak relation corresponding to $. We shall say of & relation in & set X that it 'partially orders X" in case either it is a partial order in X or else the corresponding weak relation is one If X is & partially ordered set, and if a X, the set {x X:r < a} is the initial segment determined by a; we shall usually denote it by s(a). The set { X:r & a} is the weak initial segment determined by @, and will be denoted by 8(a) When it ig important to emphasize the distinction be- tween initial segments weak initial segments, the former will be called strict initial segments. In general the words "strict" and "weak" refer to and < respectively. Thus, for instance, the initial segment determined by a may be described &s the set of all predecessors of &, O, for emphasis, as the set of all strict predecessors of @; similarly the weak initial segment determined by a consists of all weak predecessors of a. Ifz < y and y < 2, we may say that y is between € and 2; if x < y and y < 2, then y is strictly between x and 2. If t < y if there ig no element strictly between € and we say that i8 an immediate predecessor of y, or y is an immediate suc- cessor of x. If X is & partially ordered set (which may in particular be totally Or - dered) , then it could happen that X has an element a such that a & x for every € in X. In that case we gay that @ is the least (smallest, first) element of X_ The antisymmetry of an order implies that if X has & least element, then it has only one. If, similarly , X has an element a such that € < for r in X, then a is the greatest (largest, last) element of X; it too is unique (if it exists at all). The set W of all natural numbers (with its cus- tomary ordering by magnitude) is an example of partially ordered set with first element (namely 0) but no last. The same set, but this time with the inverse ordering, has & last element but no first: In partially ordered sets there is an important distinction between least elements and minimal ones: If, before, X is & partially ordered set, an element & of X is called & minimal element of X in case there is no element in X strictly smaller than Equivalently, is minimal if z < implies Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN 22, and and every
