\chapter{SECTION 25: CARDINAL NUMBERS} 

We know quite a bit about cardinal numbers by now, but we still do not know what they are. Speaking vaguely, we may say that the cardinal number of a set is the property that the set has in common with all sets equivalent to it. We may try to make this precise by saying that the cardinal number of $X$ is equal to the set of all sets equivalent to $X$, but the attempt will fail; there is no set as large as that. The next thing to try, suggested by analogy with our approach to the definition of natural numbers, is to define the cardinal number of a set $X$ as some particular carefully selected set equivalent to $X$. This is what we proceed to do. 

For each set $X$ there are too many other sets equivalent to $X$; our first problem is to narrow the field. Since we know that every set is equivalent to some ordinal number, it is not unnatural to look for the typical sets, the representative sets, among ordinal numbers. 

To be sure, a set can be equivalent to many ordinal numbers. A hopeful sign, however, is the fact that, for each set $X$, the ordinal numbers equivalent to $X$ constitute a set. To prove this, observe first that it is easy to produce an ordinal number that is surely greater, strictly greater, than all the ordinal numbers equivalent to $X$. Suppose in fact that $\gamma$ is an ordinal number equivalent to the power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$. If $\alpha$ is an ordinal number equivalent to $X$,then the set $\alpha$ is strictly dominated by the set $\gamma$ (i.e., card $\alpha$ < card $\gamma$). It follows that we cannot have $\gamma \le \alpha$, and, consequently, we must have $\alpha < \gamma$.  Since, for ordinal numbers, $\alpha < \gamma$ means the same thing as $\alpha \in \gamma$ we have found a set, namely $\gamma$, that contains every ordinal number equivalent to $X$, and this implies that the ordinal numbers equivalent to $X$ do constitute a set. 

Which one among the ordinal numbers equivalent to $X$ deserves to be singled out and called the cardinal number of $X$? The question has only one natural answer. Every set of ordinal numbers is well ordered; the
