SECTION 25 CARDINAL NUMBERS Ve know quite & bit &bout cardinal numbers by nOw, but we still do not DW what are. Speaking vaguely , we may gay that the cardinal nber of & set i8 the property that the set has in common with all sets livalent to it. We may try to make thig precise by gaying that the dinal number of X i8 equal to the set of all sets equivalent to X, but attempt will fail; there i8 no get &s 88 that_ The next thing to suggested by analogy with OuT approach to the definition of natural nbers, is to define the cardinal number of & get X 48 some particular efully gelected get equivalent to X. This i8 what we proceed to do. For each get X there are too many other gets equivalent to X; our first blem is to narrow the field_ Since we know that every set is equivalent some ordinal number; it is not unnatural to look for the typical sets, the resentative among ordinal numbers To be gure, & get can be equivalent to many ordinal numbers A hopeful however, is the fact that, for each set X, the ordinal numbers nt to X constitute & get_ To prove this, obgerve first that it is easy to duce an ordinal number that is gurely greater; strictly greater; than &ll the linal numberg equivalent to X Suppose in fact that Y is an ordinal num - equivelent to the power set P(X): If a is an ordinal number equivalent X,then the set & is strictly dominated by the set ~ (i.e , card & card ~). follows that we cannot have ~ < &, and, consequently, we must have < Y:  Since, for ordinal number8, < y means the game 98 & have found & set, namely Y, that contains every ordinal number equiv- nt to X, and this implies that the ordinal numberg equivalent to X do stitute & get_ Which one among the ordinal numbers equivalent to X deserves to be gled out called the cardinal number of X? The question has only natural angwer. Every get of ordinal numberg ig well ordered; the Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN they large sets, equiv- thing end
