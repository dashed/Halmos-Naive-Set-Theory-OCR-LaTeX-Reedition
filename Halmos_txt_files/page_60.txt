ILffo fLLTOMD the considerations that the proof involves geem to be pathological and reign to the erithmetic spirit that we expect to gee in the of nat- number8, the end justifies the means. The gecond proposition referg behavior thet ig similar to the one just excluded_ This time, how- er, the apparently artificial considerations end in an affirmative regult: mething mildly surprising always does happen. The statements are 88 lows: (i) n0 natural number i8 & subset 0f any 0f its elements, and  (ii) Ty element of a natural number i8 subset of it. Sometimeg & get with property that it includes (C) everything that it containg (e) is called ransitive get_ More precisely, to sy that E ig transitive means that if y and y € E, then x E (Recall the glightly different use of the word at we encountered in the of relationg:) In this language, (ii) gay8 at every natural number is transitive_ The proof of (i) ig & typical application of the principle of mathematical uction. Let $ be the get of all those natural numbers that are not luded in any of their elements (Explicitly: n € S if and only if n d n is not & gubset of z for any x in n.) Since 0 is not & subset of any of elements, it follows that 0 € &.  Suppose now that n €S. Since n is & bset of n, we may infer that n is not &n element of 7, and hence that n + not & subset of n What can n be & subset of? If n+ C z,then n C %, d therefore (since n € S) x € It follows that n cannot be & gubset of n + cannot be subset of any element of n. This meang that n nnot be & subget of any element of n +, hence that n +  $. The de- ed conclusion (i) is now consequence of (III) The proof of (ii) ig also inductive. Thig time let S be the get of &ll angitive natural numbers: (Explicitly: n € S if and only if n and x i8 subset of n for every € in n.) The requirement that 0 € S is vacuously tisfied.  Suppose now that n € S. If r n then either > Or I the first case x C n (gince n € S) and therefore = € n in the gecond se € C n + for even more trivial reasons. It followg that every element n + j8 & gubset of n + Or, in other words, that n + € S. The desired con- 1sion (ii) is & consequence of (III). We ere now ready to prove Suppose indeed that n gnd are tural numberg and that n Since n it follows that n d hence that either n mOr n m . Similarly , either m n 7 then we must have n Since, by (ii) , n is transi- re, it follow8 that n Since, however, n C n, this contradicts (i), and proof is complete_ The assertiong (I)-(V) are known 8s the Peano axioms; they used to considered &9 the fountainhead of all mathematical knowledge.
