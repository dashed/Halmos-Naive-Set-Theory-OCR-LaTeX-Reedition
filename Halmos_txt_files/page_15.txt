The principal concept of set the one that in completely axiomatic studies is the principal primitive (undefined) concept, is that of belonging If z belongs to A (z is &n element of A, € is contained in 4), we ghall write I € AJ Thig version of the Greek letter epsilon is 80 often used to denote belonging that its use to denote anything else is almost prohibited.

There is no compelling reason for using small and capital letters as in the preceding paragraph we might have written, and often will write, things like € y and BS Whenever possible; however, we shall infor- mally indicate the status of & set in particular hierarchy under considera- tion by means of the convention that letters at the beginning of the alpha- bet denote elements, &nd letters at the end denote sets containing them; similarly letters of & relatively simple kind denote elements, &nd letters of the larger and gaudier fonts denote sets containing them: Examples: A, A X,X possible relation between sets, more elementary than belonging, is equality: The equality of two sets A and B is universally denoted by the familiar symbol B; the fact that A and B are not equal is expressed by writing A # B The most basic property of belonging is its relation to equality, which can be formulated &s follows_ Axiom of extension.
