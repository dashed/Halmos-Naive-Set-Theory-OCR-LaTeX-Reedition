that $x = a$. For an example, consider the collection $\mathcal{C}$ of non-empty subsets of a non-empty set $X$, with ordering by inclusion. Each singleton is a minimal element of $\mathcal{C}$, but clearly $\mathcal{C}$ has no least element (unless $X$ itself is asingleton). We distinguish similarly between greatest and maximal elements; a \textit{maximal} element of $X$ is an element $a$ such that $X$ contains strictly greater than $a$. Equivalently, $a$ is maximal if $a \le x$ implies that $x = a$.
 
An element $a$ of a partially ordered set is said to be a \textit{lower bound} of a subset $E$ of $X$ in case $a \le x$ for every $x$ in $E$; similarly $a$ is an \textit{upper bound} of $E$ in case $x \le a$ for every $x$ in $E$. A set $E$ may have no lower bounds or upper bounds at all, or it may have many; in the latter case it could happen that none of them belongs to $E$. (Examples?) Let $E_{*}$ be the set of all lower bounds of $E$ in $X$ and let $E*$ be the set of all upper bounds of $E$ in $X$. What was just said is that $E_{*}$ may be empty, $E_{*} \cap E$ may be empty. If $E_{*} \cap E$ is not empty, then it is a singleton consisting of the unique least element of $E$. Similar remarks apply, of course, to $E*$. If it happens that set $E_{*}$ contains a greatest element $a$ (necessarily unique), then $a$ is called the \textit{greatest lower bound} or \textit{infimum} of $E$. The abbreviations \textit{g.l.b.} and \textit{inf} are in common use. Because of the difficulties in pronouncing the former, and even in remembering whether g.l.b. is up (greatest) or down (lower), we shall use the latter notation only. Thus inf $E$ is the unique element in $X$ (possibly not in $E$) that is lower bound of $E$ and that dominates (i.e., is greater than) every other lower bound of $E$. The definitions at the other end are completely parallel. If $E*$ has a least element $a$ (necessarily unique), then $a$ is called the \textit{least upper bound} (\textit{l.u.b.}) Or \textit{supremum} (\textit{sup}) of $E$. 

The ideas connected with partially ordered sets are easy to express but they take some time to assimilate. The reader is advised to manufacture many examples to illustrate the various possibilities in the behavior of partially ordered sets and their subsets. To aid him in this enterprise, we proceed to describe three partially ordered sets with some amusing properties. (i) The set is $\omega \times \omega$. To avoid any possible confusion, we shall denote the order we are about to introduce by the neutral symbol $R$. If $(a,b)$ and $(x, y)$ are ordered pairs of natural numbers, then $(a, b)R(x, y)$ means, by definition, that $(2a + 1) \dot 2^{y} \le (2x + 1) \dot 2^{b}$. (Here the inequality sign refers to the customary ordering of natural numbers.) The reader who is not willing to pretend ignorance of fractions will recognize that, except for notation, what we just defined is the usual order for $\frac{2a + 1}{2^{b}}$ and $\frac{2x + 1}{2^{y}$. (ii) The set is $\omega \times \omega$ again. Once more we use a neutral symbol
