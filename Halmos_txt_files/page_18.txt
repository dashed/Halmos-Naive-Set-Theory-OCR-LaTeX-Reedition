Adam. The analogy between sets and boxes has many weak points, but sometimes it gives a helpful picture of the facts. 

All that is lacking for the precise general formulation that underlies the examples above is a definition of \textit{sentence}. Here is a quick and informal one. There are two basic types of sentences, namely, assertions of belonging,

\begin{equation*}
x \in A
\end{equation*}

and assertions of equality, 

\begin{equation*}
A = B
\end{equation*}

all other sentences are obtained from such \textit{atomic} sentences by repeated applications of the usual logical operators, subject only to the minimal courtesies of grammar and unambiguity. To make the definition more explicit (and longer) it is necessary to append to it a list of the "usual logical operators" and the rules of syntax. An adequate (and, in fact, redundant) list of the former contains seven items:
 
and, 
or (in the sense of "either — or — or both"), 
not, 
if—then—(or implies),
if and only if,
for some (or there exists),
for all. 

As for the rules of sentence construction, they can be described as follows. (i) Put "not" before a sentence and enclose the result between parentheses. (The reason for parentheses, here and below, is to guarantee unambiguity. Note, incidentally, that they make all other punctuation marks unnecessary. The complete parenthetical equipment that the definition of sentences calls for is rarely needed. We shall always omit as many perentheses as it seems safe to omit without leading to confusion. In normal mathematical practice, to be followed in this book, several different sizes and shapes of parentheses are used, but that is for visual convenience only.) (ii) Put "and" or "or" or "if and only if" between two sentences and enclose the result between parentheses. (iii) Replace the dashes in "if—then—" by sentences and enclose the result in parentheses. (iv) Replace the dash in "for some—" or in "for all—" by a letter, follow the result by a sentence, and enclose the whole in parentheses. (If the letter used does not occur in the sentence, no harm is done. According to the usual and natural convention "for some $y (x \in A)$" just means "$ x \in A$ A". It is equally
