\chapter{SECTION 11: NUMBERS}

How much is two? How, more generally, are we to define numbers? To prepare for the answer, let us consider a set $X$ and let us form the collection $P$ of all unordered pairs $\{ a, b \}$, with $a$ in $X$, $b$ in $X$, and $a \neq b$. It seems clear that all the sets in the collection $P$ have property in common, namely the property of consisting of two elements. It is tempting to try to define "twoness" as the common property of all the sets in the collection $P$, but the temptation must be resisted; such a definition is, after all, mathematical nonsense. What is "property"? How do we know that there is only one property in common to all the sets in $P$? 

After some cogitation we might hit upon a way of saving the idea behind the proposed definition without using vague expressions such as "the common property". It is ubiquitous  mathematical  practice to identify a property with a set, namely with the set of all objects that possess the property; why not do it here? Why not, in other words, define "two" as the set $P$? Something like this is done at times, but it is not completely satisfying. The trouble is that our present modified proposal depends o $P$, and hence ultimately on X. At best the proposal defines twoness for subsets of $X$; it gives no hint as to when we may attribute twoness to set that is not included in X. 

There are two ways out. One way is to abandon the restriction to a particular set and to consider instead all possible unordered pais $\{ a, b \}$ with $a \neq b$. These unordered pairs do not constitute a set; in order to base the definition of "two" on them, the entire theory under consideration would have to be extended to include the "unsets" (classes) of another theory. This can be done, but it will not be done here; we shall follow a different route.
