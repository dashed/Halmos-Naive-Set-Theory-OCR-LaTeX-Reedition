SECTION 11 NUMBERS How much is two? How , more generally , are we to define numbers? To prepare for the answer, let ug consider & set X and let u8 form the col- lection P of all unordered pairs {a, 6}, with a in X, b in X, and a # b. It seems clear that all the sets in the collection P have property in com- mon namely the property of consisting of two elements_ It is tempting to try to define 'twoness' as the common property of all the sets in the collection P, but the temptation must be resisted; such a definition is, after all mathematical nonsense_ What "property"? How do we know that there is only one property in common to &ll the sets in P? After gome cogitation we might hit upon & way of the idea behind the proposed definition without vague expressions such &s "the com- mon property It i8 ubiquitous  mathematical  practice to identify property with 8 set, namely with the set of &ll objects that possess the property; why not do it here? Why not, in other words, define "two" &s the set P? Something like this is done at times, but it is not completely satisfying: The trouble is that our present modified proposal depends o P, and hence ultimately on X. At best the proposal defines twoness for gubsets of X; it gives no hint as to when we may attribute twoness to set that i8 not included in X. There are two ways out. One way is to abandon the restriction to particular get &nd to consider instead all possible unordered {a, b} with a 7 6. These unordered pairs do not constitute set; in order to base the definition of "two" on them, the entire theory under consideration would have to be extended to include the "ungets" (classes) of another theory. This can be done, but it will not be done here; we shall follow different route_ How would & mathematician define & meter?
