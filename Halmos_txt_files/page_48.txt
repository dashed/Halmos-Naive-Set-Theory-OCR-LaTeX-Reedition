of some family. If, indeed, $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of sets, let $\mathcal{C}$ itself play the role of the index set, consider the identity mapping on $\mathcal{C}$ in the role the family. 

The algebraic laws satisfied by the operation of union for pairs can be generalized to arbitrary unions. Suppose, for instance, that $ \{ I_{j} \}$ is a family of sets with domain $J$, say; write $K = \bigcup_{j}I_{j}$, and let $\{ A_{k} \}$ be a family sets with domain $K$. It is then not difficult to prove that 

\begin{equation*}
\bigcup_{k \in K}A_{k} = \bigcup_{j \in J}(\bigcup_{i \in I_{j}A_{i});
\end{equation*}

this is the generalized version of the associative law for unions. Exercise: formulate and prove a generalized version of the commutative law. 

An empty union makes gense (and is empty), but an empty intersection does not make sense. Except for this triviality, the terminology and notation for intersections parallels that for unions in every respect. Thus, for instance, if $\{ A_{i} \}$ is a non-empty family of sets, the intersection of the range of the family is called the intersection of the family $\{ A_{i} \}$, or the intersection of the sets $A_{i}$; the standard notation for it is 

\begin{equation*}
\bigcap{i \in I}A_{i} \: \text{ or } \: \bigcap_{i}A_{i},
\end{equation*}

according as it is or is not important to emphasize the index set $I$. (By a "non-empty family' we mean family whose domain $I$ is not empty.) It follows immediately from the definition of intersections that if $I \neq \emptyset$, then a necessary and sufficient condition that $x$ belong $\bigcap_{i}A_{i}$ is that $x$ belong to $A_{i}$ for all $i$. 

The generalized commutative and associative laws for intersections can be formulated and proved the same way as for unions, or, alternatively, De Morgan's laws can be used to derive them from the facts for unions. This is almost obvious, and, therefore, it is not of much interest. The interesting algebraic identities are the ones that involve both unions and intersections. Thus, for instance, if $\{ A_{i} \}$ is a family of subsets of $X$ and $B \subset X$, then 

\begin{equation*}
B \cap \bigcup_{i}A_{i} = \bigcup_{i}(B \cap A_{i})
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
B \cup \bigcap_{i}A_{i} = \bigcap_{i}(B \cup A_{i});
\end{equation*}

these equations are a mild generalization of the distributive laws.

\begin{named}[EXERCISE. ] If both $\{ A_{i} \}$ and $\{ B_{i} \}$ are families of sets, then 
\begin{equation*}
(\bigcup_{i}A_{i}) \cap (\bigcup_{j}B_{j}) = \bigcup_{i,j}(A_{i} \cap B_{j}) 
\end{equation*}

and

\begin{equation*}
(\bigcap_{i}A_{i}) \cup (\bigcap_{j}B_{j}) = \bigcap_{i,j}(A_{i} \cup B_{j}). 
\end{equation*}

Explanation of notation: a symbol such as $\bigcup_{i,j} is an abbreviation for $\bigcup_{(i,j) \in I \times J}$.
