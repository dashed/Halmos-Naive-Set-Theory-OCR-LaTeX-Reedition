The algebraic laws gatisfied by the operation of union for pairs can be neralized to arbitrary unions   Suppose, for instance, that (T;} is & fam- y of sets with domain J, say; write K U; Ij and let (At} be & family sets with domain K, It is then not difficult to prove that Utak Ax U;aJ (U;el; A;); is ig the generalized version of the associative law for unions Exercise: rmulate and prove & generalized version of the commutative law. An empty union makes gense (and is empty) , but an empty intersection nes not make genge. Except for this triviality, the terminology and nota- On for intergections parallels that for unions in every respect. Thus, for stance, if ( A;} is & non-empty family of sets, the intersection of the range the family is called the intersection of the family {A;}, or the intersec- on of the gets A;; the standard notation for it is Oia A; O: A; cording &8 it is Or is not important to emphasize the index get I. (By & on-empty family' we mean family whose domain [ is not empty ) It llows immediately from the definition of intersections that if I # 0, len 8 necessary and gufficient condition that > to O: A; is that z to A; for all i. The generalized commutative and associative laws for intersections can formulated and proved the game way &8 for unions, alternatively , Morgan'8 laws can be used to derive them from the facts for unions. his ig almost obvious, and, therefore, it is not of much interest_ The in- resting algebraic identities are the ones that involve both unions and tergectiong: Thu8, for instance; if {A;} is & family of subsets of X CX, then B n U: A; = U: (B n 4;) d B U O: A; = O; (B U A;; ese equations are & mild generalization of the distributive lews ExERCIBE: If both (A;} and {B;} are families of sets, then (U; A;) 0 (U;B;) = Uwi (A; 0 B;) and (O; A;) U (O;B;) = Ow; (A; U B;): Original ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN end belong elong and
