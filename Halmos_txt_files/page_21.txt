SECTION UNORDERED PAIRS For all that bas been gaid 80 far; we might have been operating in vacuum To give the discussion some substance, let u8 nOw officially &s- Bume that there exists a sel; Since later on we shall formulate & and more  ugeful existential assumption, this  asgumption  pleys temporary role only: One conse  quence of this innocuous seeming assumption is that there exists set without any elements at &ll. Indeed, if A is & set, apply the axiom specification to A with the sentence #z" (O1, for that matter, with any other universally false sentence) The result is the set {z € A:z # x}, and that get, clearly, has no elements The axiom of extension implies that there can be only one get with no elements: The usual gymbol for that set is 0; the set is called the empty set. The empty set is subset of every set, O, in other words, $ € A for every A. To establish this, we might argue &s follows It is to be proved that every element in $ belongs to A; since there are no elements in $, the condition is automatically fulfilled: The reasoning is correct but per- haps unsatisfying Since it is & typical example of & frequent phenomenon, condition holding in the '"vacuous'  sense, & word of advice to the inex- perienced reader might be in order_ To prove that something is true about the empty set, prove that it cannot be false: for instance, could it be false that $ € A? It could be false only if $ had an element that did not belong to A_ Since / has no elements at &ll, this is absurd.
