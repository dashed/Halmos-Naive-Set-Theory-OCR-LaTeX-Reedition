I to an initial segment of the other. If, s8y, 8 is similar to &n initial 8eg- ent of &, then 8 is similar to an element of Since every element of & an ordinal number, it follows that 8 i8 an element of &, O, in still other ords, that & is & continuation of &. We know by now that if & and 8 are istinct ordinal number8, then the gtetements 8 € &, 8 € &, i8 a continuation of 8, re all equivalent to one another; if they hold, we may write 8 < &. That we have just proved is that any two ordinal numberg are comparable; at is, if and 8 are ordinal numbers, then either 8 = or 8 < &, or < B. The result of the preceding paragraph can be expressed by gaying that rery set of ordinal numbers is totally ordered. In fact more ig true: t of ordinal numbers is well ordered. Suppose indeed that E is & nOn- npty set of ordinal numbers, &nd let & be an element of E. If & < 8 for 1 8 in E, then & is the first element of E and all ig well. If this is not the se, then there exists an element 8 in E guch that 8 < &, i.e., 8 € &; in her words, then 0 Eis not empty. Since & is & well ordered set, & n E first  element, say 00. If 8 € E, then either 4 8 (in   which cage 8) , 8 < & (in  which case 8 € & 0 E and therefore ao & 8) , and is proves that E has & first element, namely Some ordinal numbers are finite; they are just the natural numbers e elements of w). The otherg are called transfinite; the get W of all natural mbers j8 the gmallest transfinite ordinal number. Each finite ordinal mber (other than 0) has an immediate predecessor. If & transfinite Or - nal number has &n immediate predecessor 8, then, just a8 for naturel mbers, a = Not every transfinite ordinal number does have a0 mediate predecessor; the oneg that do not are called limit numbers Suppose now that @ is a  collection of ordinal numbers. Since, a8 we lve just geen, i8 & continuation chain, it follows that the union sets of @ is a well ordered set such that for every Fin @, distinct from itself & i8 & continuation of The initial gegment determined by an ement in a is the same &8 the initial segment determincd by that element hatever get of @ it occurs in; this implieg that is &n ordinal number: {0 @, then } & a; the number & is an upper bound of the elements of Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN every (i.e ,
