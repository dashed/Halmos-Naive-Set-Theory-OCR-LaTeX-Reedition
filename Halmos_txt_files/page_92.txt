to an initial segment of the other. If, say, $\beta$ is similar to an initial segment of $\alpha$, then $\beta$ is similar to an element of $\alpha$. Since every element of $\alpha$ is an ordinal number, it follows that $\beta$ is an element of $\alpha$, or, in still other words, that $\alpha$ is a continuation of $\beta$. We know by now that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are distinct ordinal numbers, then the statements 

\begin{center}
$\beta \in \alpha$,

$\beta \subset \alpha$,

$\alpha$ \textit{is a continuation of} $\beta$,
end{center}

are all equivalent to one another; if they hold, we may write
\begin{equation*}
\beta < \alpha
\end{equation*}

What we have just proved is that any two ordinal numbers are comparable; that is, if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers, then either $\beta = \alpha$, or $\beta < \alpha$, or $\alpha < \beta$. 

The result of the preceding paragraph can be expressed by saying that every set of ordinal numbers is totally ordered. In fact more is true: every set of ordinal numbers is well ordered. Suppose indeed that $E$ is a non-empty set of ordinal numbers, and let $\alpha$ be an element of $E$. If $\alpha \le  \beta$ for all $\beta$ in $E$, then $\alpha$ is the first element of $E$ and all is well. If this is not the case, then there exists an element $\beta$ in $E$ such that $\beta < \alpha$, i.e., $\beta \in \alpha$; in other words, then $\alpha \cap E$ is not empty. Since $\alpha$ is a well ordered set, $\alpha \cap E$ has a first element, say $\alpha_{0}$. If $\beta \in E$, then either $\alpha \le \beta$ (in which case $\alpha_{0} < \beta$), or $\beta < \alpha$ (in which case $\beta \in \alpha \cap E$ and therefore $\alpha_{0} \le \beta$), and is proves that $E$ has a first element, namely $\alpha_{0}$.

Some ordinal numbers are finite; they are just the natural numbers (i.e., the elements of $\omega$). The others are called \textit{transfinite}; the set $\omega$ of all natural numbers is the smallest transfinite ordinal number. Each finite ordinal number (other than $0$) has an immediate predecessor. If a transfinite ordinal number $\alpha$ has an immediate predecessor $\beta$, then, just as for natural numbers, $\alpha = \beta^{+}$. Not every transfinite ordinal number does have an immediate predecessor; the ones that do not are called \textit{limit numbers}. 

Suppose now that $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of ordinal numbers. Since, as we have just seen, $\mathcal{C}$ is a continuation chain, it follows that the union $\alpha$ of the sets of $\mathcal{C}$ is a well ordered set such that for every $\xi$ in $\mathcal{C}$, distinct from $\alpha$ itself, $\alpha$ is a continuation of $\xi$. The initial segment determined by an element in $\alpha$ is the same as the initial segment determined by that element whatever set of $\mathcal{C}$ it occurs in; this implies that $\alpha$ is an ordinal number. If $\xi \in \mathcal{C}$, then $\xi \le \alpha$; the number $\alpha$ is an upper bound of the elements of
