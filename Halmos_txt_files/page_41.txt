NANd SDI TfLOf 1 DEC_ in & get is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive: The smallest equivalence relation in 8 set X is the relation of equality in X; the largest equivalence relation in X is X x X There is an intimate connection between equivalence relations in & set X and certain collections (called partitions) of subsets of X_ A partition of X is disjoint collection @ of non-empty subsets of X whose union is X If R is an equivalence relation in X, and if € is in X, the equivalence of x with respect to R is the set of all those elements y in X for which € R y. (The weight of tradition makes the use of the word "class" at this point unavoidable:) Examples: if R is equality in X, then each equivalence class i8 & singleton; if R X X X, then the get X itself is the oly equivalence class: There is no standard notation for the equivalence class of with respect to R; we shall usually denote it by x/R, and we shall write X/R for the set of all equivalence classes (Pronounce X/R &s "X modulo R; Or , in abbreviated form, "X mod R:" Exercise: show that X/R is indeed set by exhibiting & condition that specifies exactly the subset X /R of the power set P(X) ) Now forget R for moment and begin anew with partition @ of X_ relation, which we shall cell X/@, is defined in X by writing Xle just in case € and y belong to the game get of the collection We shall X/e the relation induced by the pertition In the preceding paragraph we saw how to associate & get of subsets of X with every equivalence relation in X and to associate & relation in X with every partition of X_ The connection between equivalence rela- tiong &nd partitions can be described by saying that the passage to X/@ is exactly the reverse of the passage from R to X/R More if R is an equivalence relation in X_ then the set of equivalence classes is & partition of X that induces the relation R, and if @ is & partition of X, then the induced relation is &n equivalence relation whose get of equivalence classes is exactly @. For the proof; let u8 start with an equivalence relation R. Since each x belongs to some equivalence cless (for instance € I/R), it is clear that the union of the equivalence classes is all X If 2 €I/R 0 y/R, then > R 2 and 2 R y, and therefore Ry: This implies that if two equivelence classes have an element in common, then they are identical; O; in other words, that two distinct  equivalence classes are always   disjoint. The set  of equivalence classeg is therefore & partition.
