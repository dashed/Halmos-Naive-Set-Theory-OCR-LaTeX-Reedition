NUMBERS 45 on. Incidentally, the symbol we are using for the set of all natural mbers (w) plurality of the votes of the writers o the subject, but like clear majority_ In this book that symbol will be used sy8- natically exclusively in the gense defined above The slight feeling of discomfort that the reader may experience in con- tion with the definition of natural numbers is common and in st cases temporary. The trouble is that here, once before (in the inition of ordered pairs) , the object defined has gome irrelevant struc- "e, which seems to get in the way (but is in fact harmless). We want be told that the guccessor of 7 is 8, but to be told that 7 i8 & subset of 8 that 7 is an element of 8 i8 disturbing We shall make use of this super- ucture of naturel numbers just long enough to derive their most impor- t' natural properties; after that the superstructure may safely be for- iten family (z;} whose index set is either a natural number O else the set all natural numbers is called sequence (finite or infinite, {A;} is & sequence of sets, where the index is the natural number n the union of the sequence is denoted by U%-o A; Ao U:.U An: the index set i8 W, the notation is Uz-o A; or Ao U 4, U Az U . tersections and Cartesian products of sequences are denoted similarly by Ozzo A; Ao 0..0 An, Xi-o A; Ao Xr"X An Ozo A; Ao 0 A, 0 4z 0.. Xi-o A; Ao X AxX Az X. = word "sequence" is used in few different ways in the mathematical erature, but the differences among them are more notational than con- ptual: The most common alternative starts at 1 instead of 0; in other rds; it refer8 to & family whose index set is w {0} instead of w.
