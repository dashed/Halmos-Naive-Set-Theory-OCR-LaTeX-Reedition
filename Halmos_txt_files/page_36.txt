ORDERED PAIRS 23 the one that is included in all the ones that remain after {c} is removed; ce {b, c} fills the bill (and nothing else does) , we know that b must have n the gecond element Proceeding thus (only two more steps are needed) pass from the Bet @ to the given ordering of the given set A_ The moral is this: we may not know precisely what it means to order the ment8 of a set 4, but with each order we can associate & get @ of subsets A in such wey that the given order can be uniquely recaptured from (Here is & non-trivial exercise: find an intrinsic characterization of those of subsets of A that correspond to some order in 4_ Since "order" no official meaning for u8 yet, the whole problem is officially meaning- Nothing that follows depends on the solution, but the reader would something valuable by trying to find it:) The passage from an order to the set @, and back was illustrated above for & quadruple; for & everything becomes at least twice as simple: If A {a,b} and if, in desired  order; comes first, then {(a} , {a,b} } ; if, however; nes first, then {{6} , {a, 6} } The ordered pair of a and b, with first coordinate a &nd gecond coordinate the get (a, b) defined by 4) (a,b) {{a}, {a, b} } . wever convincing the motivation of this definition may be, we must 1 prove that the result has the main property that an ordered must ve to deserve its name_ We must show that if (a,6) and (z, y) are Or- ed pairs and if (a,6) (z,y) , then =I and b =y: To prove this note first that if a and b happen to be equal, then the ordered (a,6) the same a8 the singleton { {a} } . If, conversely , (a,b) is singleton {a} {a,6} , 80 that b (a),and therefore a Suppose now that 6) (1,y) . If a b, then both (a, 6) (x,y) are singletons, 80 that 9; since {z} (a,b) and {a) (2,y), it follows that a, b, €, and y are equal. If a = b, then both (a, 6) and (x, y) contain exactly one single namely {a) and respectively, s0 that a Since in this case it lso true that both (a,6) and (z, y) contain exactly one unordered pair t is not a singleton, namely {a, 6} {z, y} respectively, it follows that 6} {z,y}, and therefore; in particular, b € (z,y} _ Since b cannot be for then we should have and =%, and, therefore, 6), we st have b Y, and the is complete. and B are sets, does there exist & set that containg all the ordered (a,b) with a in 4 and b in B?
