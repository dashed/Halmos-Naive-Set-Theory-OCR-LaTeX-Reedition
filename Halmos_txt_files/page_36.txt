i.e., the one that is included in all the ones that remain after $ \{ c \} $ is removed; since $ \{ b, c \} $ fills the bill (and nothing else does), we know that $b$ must have been the second element. Proceeding thus (only two more steps are needed) we pass from the set $ \mathcal{C} $ to the given ordering of the given set $A$. 

The moral is this: we may not know precisely what it means to order the elements of a set $A$, but with each order we can associate a set $ \mathcal{C} $ of subsets of $A$ in such a way that the given order can be uniquely recaptured from $ \mathcal{C} $. (Here is a non-trivial exercise: find an intrinsic characterization of those sets of subsets of $A$ that correspond to some order in $A$. Since "order" has no official meaning for us yet, the whole problem is officially meaningless. Nothing that follows depends on the solution, but the reader would learn something valuable by trying to find it.) The passage from an order in $A$ to the set $ \mathcal{C} $, and back, was illustrated above for a quadruple; for a pair everything becomes at least twice as simple. If $ A = \{ a,b \}$ and if, in the desired ordera $a$ comes first, then $ \mathcal{C} = \{ \{ a \} , \{ a,b \} \}$; if, however $b$ comes first, then $ \mathcal{C} = \{ \{ b \}, \{a, b \}\}$. 

The \textit{ordered pair} of $a$ and $b$, with \textit{first coordinate a} and \textit{second coordinat b}, is the set $(a, b)$ defined by 

\begin{equation*}
(a, b) = \{ \{a \} , \{ a, b \} \}.
\end{equation*}

However convincing the motivation of this definition may be, we must strill prove that the result has the main property that an ordered must have to deserve its name. We must show that if $(a,b)$ and $(x, y)$ are ordered pairs and if $(a,b) = (x,y)$, then $ a = x $ and $b = y$. To prove this, we note first that if $a$ and $b$ happen to be equal, then the ordered pair $(a,b)$ is the same as the singleton $ \{ \{ a \} \} $. If, conversely, $(a,b)$ is a singleton, then $ \{ a \} =  \{ a , b \}$, so that $ b \in \{ a \} $, and therefore $a = b$. Suppose now that $ (a, b) = (x, y)$. If $ a = b $, then both $(a, b)$ and $(x,y)$ are singletons, so that $ x = y $; since $ \{ x \} \in (a,b)$ and $ {a \} \in (x,y)$, it follows that \texit{a, b, x,} and $y$ are all equal. If $a \neq b$, then both $(a, b)$ and $(x, y)$ contain exactly one singleton, namely $ \{a \}$ and $ \{ x \} $ respectively, so that $a = x$. Since in this case it is also true that both $(a,b)$ and $(x, y)$ contain exactly one unordered pair that is not a singleton, namely $ \{a, b \}$ and $ \{ x, y \}$. respectively, it follows that $ \{ a, b \} = \{ x,y \} $, and therefore, in particular, $b \in \{ x,y \} $. Since $b$ cannot be $x$ (for then we should have $ a = x $ and $ b = x $, and, therefore, $ a = b $), we must have $b = y $, and the proof is complete. 

If $A$ and $B$ are sets, does there exist a set that contains all the ordered pairs $(a,b)$ with $a$ in $A$ and $b$ in $B$? It is quite easy to see that the answer is yes. Indeed, if $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, then $ \{ a \} \subset A$ and $ \{ b \}  \subset B$, and therefore $ \{ a, b \} \subset A \cup B$. Since also $ \{ a \} \subset A \cup B$, it follows that both $ \{ a \}$
