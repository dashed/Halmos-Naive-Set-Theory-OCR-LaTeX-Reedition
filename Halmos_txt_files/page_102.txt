Suppose that f is & mapping from X into Y and g is & map- ping from Y into X Prove that there exist subsets A and B of X and Y respectively, such that f(A) B and g(Y B) X This result can be used to give proof of the Schroder-Bernstein  theorem hat looks quite different from the one above. By now we know that domination has the essential properties of & partial we conclude this introductory discussion by observing that the order n fact total. The assertion is known 48 the comparability theorem for s: it gay8 that if X and Y are sets, then either X < Y o Y < X The of an immediate consequence of the well ordering theorem and of comparability theorem for well ordered sets_ Well order both X and use the fact that either the well ordered sets S0 obtained are similar one of them is similar to an initial segment of the other; in the former e X and Y are equivalent, in the latter oe of them is equivalent subset of the other_ Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN one- 9 `1 ler;` and and
