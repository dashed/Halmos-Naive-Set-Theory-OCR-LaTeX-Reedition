of $g^{-1}$ to $X_{Y}$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $X_{Y}$ and $Y_{Y}$. If, finally, $x \in X_{infty}$, then $f(x) \in Y_{infty}$, and the restriction of $f$ to $X_{infty}$ is a to correspondence between $X_{infty}$ and  $Y_{infty}$; alternatively, if $x \in X_{infty}$, then $g^{-1}(x) \in Y_{infty}$, and the restriction of $g^{-1}$ to $X_{infty}$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $X_{infty}$ and $Y_{infty}$. By combining these three one-to-one correspondences, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between $X$ and $Y$. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE. ] Suppose that $f$ is a mapping from $X$ into $Y$ and $g$ is a mapping from $Y$ into $X$. Prove that there exist subsets $A$ and $B$ of $X$ and $Y$ respectively, such that $f(A) = B$ and $g(Y - B) = X - A$. This result can be used to give a proof of the Schr√∂der-Bernstein theorem that looks quite different from the one above.

By now we know that domination has the essential properties of a partial order; we conclude this introductory discussion by observing that the order is in fact total. The assertion is known as the comparability theorem for sets: it says that if $X$ and $Y$ are sets, then either $X \presim Y$ or $Y \presim X$. The proof is an immediate consequence of the well ordering theorem and of comparability theorem for well ordered sets. Well order both $X$ and $Y$ and use the fact that either the well ordered sets so obtained are similar or one of them is similar to an initial segment of the other; in the former case $X$ and $Y$ are equivalent, in the latter one of them is equivalent to a subset of the other.
