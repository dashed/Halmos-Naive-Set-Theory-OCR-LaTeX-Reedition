does not hold. Suppose, for instance, that we consider human beings instead of sets, and that, if $x$ and $A$ are human beings, we write $x \in A$ whenever $x$ is an ancestor of $A$. (The ancestors of a human being are his parents, his parents' parents, their parents, etc., etc.) The analogue of the axiiom of extension would say here that if two human beings are equal, then they have the same ancestors (this is the "only if" part, and it is true), and also that if two human being the same ancestors, then they are equal (this is the "if" part, and it is false). 
\\

	If $A$ and $B$ are sets if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$, we say that $A$ is a /textit{subset} of $B$, or $B$ \textit{includes} $A$, and we write 

\begin{equation*}
A \subset B
\end{equation*}

or

\begin{equation*}
A \supset B
\end{equation*}

The wording of the definition implies that each set must be considered to be included in itself ($A \subset A$); this fact is described by saying that set inclusion is \textit{reflexive}. (Note that; in the same sense of the word, equality also is reflexive.) If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that $A \subset B$ and $A \neq B$, the word $proper$ is used (proper subset, proper inclusion). If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets such that $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$, then $A \subset C$; this fact is described by saying that set inclusion is \textit{transitive}. (This property is also shared by equality.)
\\

	If $A$ and $B$ are sets such that $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same elements and therefore, by the axiom of extension, $A = B$. This fact is described by saying that set inclusion is \textit{antisymmetric}. (In this respect set inclusion behaves differently from equality. Equality is \textit{symmetric}, in the sense that if $A = B$, then necessarily $B = A$.) The axiom of extension can, in fact, be reformulated in these terms: if $A$ and $B$ are sets, then a necessary and sufficient condition that $A = B$ is that both $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$. Correspondingly , almost all proofs of equalities between two sets $A$ and $B are split into two parts; first show that $A \subset B$, and then show that $B \subset A$.

	Observe that belonging ($ \in$) and inclusion ($ \subset$) are conceptually very different indeed. One important difference has already manifested itself above: inclusion is always reflexive, whereas it is at all clear that belonging is ever reflexive. That is: $A \subset A$ is always true; is $A \in A$ ever true? It is certainly not true of any reasonable set that anyone has ever seen. Observe, along the same lines, that inclusion is transitive, whereas belonging is not. Everyday examples, involving, for instance, super-organizations whose members are organizations, will readily occur to the interested reader.
