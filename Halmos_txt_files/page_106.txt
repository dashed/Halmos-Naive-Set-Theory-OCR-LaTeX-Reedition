23 COUNT ABLE SETS Cantor's theorem. set i8 striclly dominaled by its power set, OT , in other words, X < c(X) for all X. PROoF . There is natural one-to-one  mapping X into (X) amely, the mapping that associates with each element  of X the single n {x}. The existence of this mapping proves that X < P(X); it remains prove that X is not equivalent to P(X) Assume that f is & one-to-one mapping from X onto C(X); our purpose to show that this assumption  leads contradiction. Write X:r & f(z)}; in words, congists of those elements of X that are ot contained in the corresponding set_ Since P(X) and since f maps onto G(X), there exists an element @ in X such that f(a) The ele - ent either belongs to the set or it does not If a â‚¬ 4, then; by the finition of A, we must have f(a) , and since f(a) A this i8 impos- ble. If a & A, then, again by the definition of 4, we must have @ ef(a), d this too is impossible. The contradiction has arrived and the proof of antor'8 theorem is complete Since P(X) is always equivalent to 2X (where 2X is the set of &ll functions om X into 2), Cantor's theorem implies that X 2X for all X If in rticular we take W in the role of X, then we may conclude that the set all sets of natural numbers is uncountable (i.e,, not countable, non-de- merable) , Or, equivalently, that 2" is uncountable. Here 2w js the set all infinite sequences of 0's and 1'8 (i.e , functions from W into 2). Note at if we interpret 2" in the gense of ordinal exponentiation, then 2" js untable (in fact 2" = W)_ Original Mom ed by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN Every from
