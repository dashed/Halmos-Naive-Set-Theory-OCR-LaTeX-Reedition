UnDLILD rfino red ((a,6) {{a}, {a, b} }) is frequently relegated to pathological theory. For the benefit of those who think that in this case the name eserved we note that the definition has served its purpose by now and never be used We need to know that ordered pairg are deter- ed by &nd uniquely determine their first and second coordinates, that tesian products can be formed, that every set of ordered pair8 i8 & set of gome Cartesian product; which particuler approach i8 used to leve these ends is immaterial. is easy to locate the source of the mistrust and suspicion that many hematicians feel toward the explicit definition of ordered given ve. The trouble is not that there is anything wrong O anything miss- the relevant properties of the concept we defined are all correct t is, in accord with the demands of intuition) and all the correct proper- are present. The trouble is that the concept has gome irrelevant prop- that are accidental and  distracting_ The theorem that (a, 6) 1) if and only if a = and b y i8 the gort of we expect to learn ut ordered pairg. The fact that {a, b} (a,6) , on the other hand, seems dental; it is & freak property of the definition rather than an intrinsic erty of the concept. he charge of grtificiality is true; but it is not too high 8 price to pay onceptual economy: The concept of an ordered pair could have been oduced as an additional primitive, axiomatically endowed with just the properties, no more and no less. In some theories this is done. The hematician'& choice ig between having to remember & few more axioms having to forget few accidental facts; the choice is pretty clearly ter of taste. Similar choices occur frequently in mathematics; in this <, for instance, we shall encounter them connection with the itiong of numberg of varioug kindg. XERCIBE_ If A, B, X,and Y are sets, then (i) (A U B) xx = (AxX) U (Bx X), (ii) (A n B) X (X n Y) = (Axx n (BX Y), (iii) (4 - B)xx = (Axx) - (Bxx): either 0 or B = $, then A X B = $, and conversely .
