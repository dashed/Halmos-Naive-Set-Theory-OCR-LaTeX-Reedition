ordered pair $((a,b) = \{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \})$ is frequently relegated to pathological set theory. For the benefit of those who think that in this case the name is deserved, we note that the definition has served its purpose by now and willnever be used again. We need to know that ordered pairs are determined by and uniquely determine their first and second coordinates, that Cartesian products can be formed, and that every set of ordered pairs is a subset of some Cartesian product; which particular approach is used to achieve these ends is immaterial. 

It is easy to locate the source of the mistrust and suspicion that many mathematicians feel toward the explicit definition of ordered given above. The trouble is not that there is anything wrong or anything missing; the relevant properties of the concept we defined are all correct (that is, in accord with the demands of intuition) and all the correct properties are present. The trouble is that the concept has some irrelevant properties that are accidental and  distracting. The theorem that $(a, b) = (x, y)$ if and only if $a = x$ and $b = y$ is the sort of thing we expect to learn about ordered pairs. The fact that $\{ a, b \} \in (a,b) $, on the other hand, seems accidental; it is a freak property of the definition rather than an intrinsic property of the concept.

The charge of artificiality is true; but it is not too high a price to pay for conceptual economy. The concept of an ordered pair could have been introduced as an additional primitive, axiomatically endowed with just the right properties, no more and no less. In some theories this is done. The mathematician's choice is between having to remember a few more axioms and having to forget a few accidental facts; the choice is pretty clearly a matter of taste. Similar choices occur frequently in mathematics; in this book, for instance, we shall encounter them again in connection with the definitions of numbers of various kinds. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE.  ] If $A$, $B$, $X$, and $Y$ are sets, then 

\begin{center}

(i) $ (A \cup B) \times X = ( A \times X ) \cup ( B \times X),$


(ii) $ (A \cap B ) \times ( X \cap Y) = (A \times X) \cap ( B \times Y),$

(iii) $ (A - B ) \times X = (A \times X) - (B \times X).
\end{center}

If either $A = \emptyset $ or $B = \emptyset $, then $ A \times B = \emptyset $, and conversely. If $ A \subset X $ and $B \subset Y$, then $A \times B \subset X \times Y$, and (provided $A \times B \neq \emptyset $ ) conversely.
