Not all the familiar laws of exponents hold; thus, for instance, $( \alpha \beta)^{\gamma}$ is in general different from $\alpha^{\gamma} \beta^{\gamma}$. Example: $(2 \dot 2)^{\omega} = 4^{\omega} = \omega$, but $2^{\omega} \dot 2^{\omega} = \omega \dot \omega =  \omega^{2}$ 

Warning: the exponent notation for ordinal numbers, here and below, is not consistent with our earlier use of it. The unordered set $2^{\omega}$ of all functions from $\omega$ to $2$, and the well ordered set $2^{\omega}$ that is the least upper bound of the sequence of ordinal numbers $2, 2 \dot 2, 2 \dot 2 \dot 2$, etc., are not the same thing at all. There is no help for it; mathematical usage is firmly established in both cemps. If, in a particular situation, the context not reveal which of the two interpretations is to be used, then explicit verbal indication must be given.
