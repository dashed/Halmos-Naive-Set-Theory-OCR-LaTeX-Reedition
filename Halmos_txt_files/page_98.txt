ORDINAL ARITHMETIC 85 t all the familiar lewg of exponents hold; thus, for instance, (a8)Y is in eral  different from & 87. Example: (2.2) " 40 =W, but 2".2" 02 Narning: the exponent notation for ordinal numbers, here and below, is consistent with our earlier use of it_ The unordered set 2" of all func- to 2, and the well ordered set 2" that is the least upper bound the sequence of ordinal numbers 2, 2.2, 2.2.2, etc , are not the same ng at all. There is no help for it; mathematical usage is firmly estab- ed in both cemps. If, in & particular situation, the context not eal which of the two interpretations is to be used, then explicit verbal ication must be given.
