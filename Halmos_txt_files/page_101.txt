conclusion is that $X$ is equivalent to a subset of $Z$. In other words, if $X \presim Y$ and  $Y \presim Z$,then $X \presim Z$. 

The interesting question is that of antisymmetry. If $X \presim Y$ and $Y \presim X$, can we conclude that $X = Y$? This is absurd; the assumptions are satisfied whenever $X$ and $Y$ are equivalent, and equivalent sets need not be identical. What then can we say about two sets if all we know is that each of them is equivalent to a subset of the other? The answer is contained in the following celebrated and important result.

REMARK. Observe that the converse, which is incidentally a considerable strengthening of the assertion of reflexivity, follows trivially from the definition of domination. 

PROOF. Let $f$ be a one-to-one mapping from $X$ into $Y$ and let $g$ be a one-to-one mapping from $Y$ into $X$; the problem is to construct a one-to-one correspondence between $X$ and $Y$. It is convenient to assume that the sets $X$ and $Y$ have no elements in common; if that is not true, we can so easily make it true that the added assumption  involves no loss of generality. 

We shall say that an element $x$ in $X$ is the \textit{parent} of the element $f(x)$ in $Y$, and, similarly, that an element $y$ in $Y$ is the parent of $g(y)$ in $X$. Each element $x$ of $X$ has an infinite sequence of \textit{descendants}, namely, $f(x)$, $g(f(x))$, $f(g(f(x)))$, and similarly, the descendants of an element $y$ of $Y$ are $g(y)$, $f(g(y))$, $g(f(g(y)))$, etc. This definition implies that each term in the sequence is a descendant of all preceding terms; we shall also say that term in the sequence is an \textit{ancestor} of all following terms. 

For each element (in either $X$ or $Y$) one of three things must happen. If we keep tracing the ancestry of the element back as far as possible, then either we ultimately come to an element of $X$ that has no parent (these orphans are exactly the elements of $X - g(Y)$), or we ultimately come to an element of $Y$ that has no parent $(Y - f(X))$, or the lineage regresses ad infinitum. Let $X_{X}$ be the set of those elements of $X$ that originate in $X$(i.e., $X_{X}$ consists of the elements of $X - g(Y)$ together with all their descendants in $X$), let $X_{Y}$ be the set of those elements of $X$ that originate in $Y$ (i.e., $X_{Y}$ consists of all the descendants in $X$ of the elements of $Y - f(X)$), let $X_{infty}$ be the set of those elements of $X$ that have no parentless ancestors. Partition $Y$ similarly into the three sets $Y_{X}$, $Y_{Y}$, and $Y_{infty}$. 

If $x \in X_{X}$, then $f(x) \in Y_{X}$, and, in fact, the restriction of $f$ to $X_{X}$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $X_{X}$ and $Y_{X}$. If $x \in X_{Y}$, then $x$ belongs to the domain of the inverse function $g^{-1}$ and $g^{-1}(x) \in Y_{Y}$; in fact the restriction
