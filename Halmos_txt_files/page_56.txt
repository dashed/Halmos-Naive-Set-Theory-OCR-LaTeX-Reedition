to the one sketched above would involve the following two steps. First, select an object that is one of the intended models of the concept being definedâ€”an object, in other words, such that on intuitive or practical grounds it deserves to be called one meter if anything does. Second, form the set of all objects in the universe that are of the same length as the selected one (note that this does not depend on knowing what a meter is), and define a meter as the set so formed. 

How in fact is a meter defined? The example was chosen so that the answer to this question should suggest an approach to the definition of numbers. The point is that in the customary definition of a meter the second step is omitted. By a more or less arbitrary convention an object is selected and its length is called a meter. If the definition is accused of circularity (what does "length" mean?), it can easily be converted into an unexceptionable demonstrative definition; there is after all nothing to stop from defining a meter as equal to the selected object. If this demonstrative approach is adopted, it is just as easy to explain as before when "one-meter-ness" shall be attributed to some other object, namely, just in case the new object has the same length as the selected standard. We comment again that to det /ermine whether two  objects have the same length depends on a simple act of comparison only, and does not depend on having a precise definition of length. 

Motivated by the considerations described above, we have earlier defined $2$ some particular set with (intuitively speaking) exactly two elements. How was that standard set selected? How should other such standard sets for other numbers be selected? There is no compelling mathematical reason for preferring one answer to this question to another; the whole thing is largely a matter of taste. The selection should presumably be guided by considerations of simplicity and economy. To motivate the particular selection that is usually made, suppose that a number, say $7$, has already been defined as a set (with seven elements). How in this case, should we define $8$? Where, in other words, can we find a set consisting of exactly eight elements? We can find seven elements in the set $7$; what shall we use as an eighth to adjoin to them? A reasonable answer to the last question is the number (set) $7$ itself; the proposal is to define $8$ to be the set consisting of the seven elements of $7$, together with $7$. Note that according to this proposal each number will be equal to the set of its own predecessors. 

The preceding paragraph motivates a set-theoretic construction that makes sense for every set, but that is of interest in the construction of numbers only. For every set $x$ we define the \textit{successor} $x^{+}$ of $x$ to be the set obtained by adjoining $x$ to the elements of $x$; in other words,
