well known example of a total order is the relation "less than or equal to" in the set of natural numbers. An interesting and frequently seen partial order is the relation of extension for functions. Explicitly: for given sets $X$ and $Y$, let $F$ be the set of all those functions whose domain is included in $X$ and whose range is included in $Y$. Define a relation $R$ in $F$ by writing $fRg$ in case dom $f \subset$ dom $g$ and $f(x) = g(x)$ for all $x$ in dom $f$; in other words, $fRg$ means that $f$ is a restriction of $g$, or, equivalently, that $g$ is an extension of $f$. If we recall that the functions in $F$ are, after all, certain subsets of the Cartesian product $X \times Y$, we recognize that $fRg$ means the same as $f subset g$; extension is a special case of inclusion.

A \textit{partially ordered set} is a set together with a partial order in it. A precise formulation of this "togetherness" goes as follows: a partially ordered set is an ordered pair $(X, \le)$, where $X$ is a set and $\le$ is a partial order in $X$. This kind of definition is very common in mathematics; & mathematical structure is almost always a set "together" with some specified other sets, functions, and relations. The accepted way of making such definitions precise is by reference to ordered pairs, triples, or whatever is appropriate. That is not the only way. Observe, for instance, that knowledge of a partial order implies knowledge of its domain. If, therefore, we describe a partially ordered set as an ordered pair, we are being quiet redundant; the second  coordinate alone would have conveyed the same amount of information. In matters of language and notation, however, tradition always conquers pure reason. The accepted mathematical behavior (for structures in general, illustrated here for partially ordered sets) is to admit that ordered pairs are the right approach, to forget that the second coordinate is the important one, and to speak as if the coordinate were all that mattered. Following custom, we shall often say something like "let $X$ be a partially ordered set," when what we really mean is "let X be the domain of a partial order." The same linguistic conventions apply to totally ordered sets, i.e., to partially ordered sets whose order is in fact total. 

The theory of partially ordered sets uses many words whose technical meaning is so near to their everyday connotation that are almost self-explanatory. Suppose, to be specific, that $X$ is a partially ordered set and that $x$ and $y$ are elements of $X$. We write $y \ge x$ in case $x \le y$; in other words, $\ge$ is the inverse of the relation $\le$. If $x \le y$ and $x \neq y$, we write $x < y$ and we say that $x$ is \textit{less} than or \textit{smaller} than $y$, or that $x$ is a \textit{predecessor} of $y$. Alternatively, under the same circumstances, we write $y > x$ and we say that $y$ is \textit{greater} or \textit{larger} than $x$, or $y$ is a \textit{successor} of $x$. The relation $<$ is such that (i) for no elements $x$ and $y$ do $x < y$ and $y < x$ hold simultaneously,
