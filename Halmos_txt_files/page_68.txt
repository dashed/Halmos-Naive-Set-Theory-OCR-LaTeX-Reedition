14 ORDER 55 Il known example of & total order is the relation "legg than to" the get of natural numbers. An interesting &nd frequently &een partial ler i8 the relation of extension for functiong_ Explicitly: for given sets and Y, let F be the get of all those functiong whose domain ig included whose range is included in Y. Define & relation R in F by writing ' 9 in case dom f € dom g and f(~) g(z) for all z in dom f; in other rds, f R g means that f is & restriction of 9, Or, equivalently, that g is an ension of f: If we recall that the functiong in F are, after &ll, certain osets of the Cartegian product X X Y, we recognize that f R g means game &s f C g; extension is & special case of inclusion A partially ordered set is & get together with & partial order in it. A pre- formulation of this "togetherness" goes &8 follows: & partially ordered j8 an ordered (X, &), where X j8 & set and & is & partial order in This kind of definition is very common in mathematics; & mathemati- structure is almost always Bet "together' - with some specified other functions, &nd relationg The accepted way of making such defini- n8 precise is by reference to ordered pairs, triples, Or whatever is appro ate. That is not the only way Observe, for instance, that knowledge partial order implies knowledge of its domain. If, therefore, we de- ibe & partially ordered get &8 an ordered pair, we are re- ndant; the second  coordinate alone would have  conveyed the same ount of information. In matters of language and notation, however, dition always conquers pure reason. The accepted mathematical be- vior (for structures in general, illustrated here for partially ordered sets) to admit that ordered pairs are the right approach, to forget that the ond coordinate is the important one, to speak &s if the coordi- te were all that mattered_ Following custom, we shall often say some ng like "let X be & partially ordered set, when what we really mean is t X be the domain of & partial order: The same linguistic conventions ply to totally ordered sets, i.e , to partially ordered gets whose order is fact total_ The theory of partially ordered sets uses many words whose technical i8 80 near to their everyday connotation that are almost self- lanatory.  Suppose, to be specific, that X is & partially ordered get and and y are elements of X_ We write y 2 z in case * 4 y; in other rds, 2 is the inverse of the relation <- If x < y and € # y, we write < y and we say that € is less than O smaller than %, or that € is & predeces- 'of y. Alternatively , under the gme circumstances, we write y > and say that y is greater or larger than %, Or y is & successor of €. The relation is guch that (i) for no elements € and y do x < y and y < r hold simul- Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN equal and pair being quite and first aning they
