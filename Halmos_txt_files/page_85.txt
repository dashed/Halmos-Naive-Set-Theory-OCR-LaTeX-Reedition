The identity mapping on a partially ordered set $X$ is a similarity from $X$ onto $X$. If $X$ and $Y$ are partially ordered sets and if $f$ is a similarity from $X$ onto $Y$, then (since $f$ is one-to-one) there exists an unambiguously determined inverse function $f^{-1}$ from $Y$ onto $X$, and $f^{-1}$ is a similarity. If, moreover, $g$ is a similarity from $Y$ onto A partially ordered set $Z$, then the composite $gf$ is a similarity from $X$ onto $Z$. It follows from these comments that if we restrict attention to some particular set $E$, and if, accordingly, we consider only such partial orders whose domain is a subset of $E$, then similarity is an equivalence relation in the set of partially ordered sets so obtained. The same is true if we narrow the field even further and consider only well orderings whose domain is included in $E$; similarity is an equivalence relation in the set of well ordered sets so obtained. Although similarity was defined for partially ordered sets in complete generality, and the subject can be studied on that level, our interest in what follows will be in similarity for well ordered sets only. 

It is easily possible for a well ordered set to be similar to proper subset; for an example consider the set of all natural numbers and the set of all even numbers. (As always, a natural number $m$ is defined to be even if there exists a natural number $n$ such that $m = 2n$. The mapping $n \rightarrow 2n$ is a similarity from the set of all natural numbers onto the set of all even numbers.) A similarity of a well ordered set with a part of itself is, however, a very special kind of mapping. If, in fact, $f$ is a similarity of a well ordered set $X$ into itself, then $a \le f(a)$ for each $a$ in $X$. The proof is based directly on the definition of well ordering. If there are elements $b$ such that $f(b) < b$, then there is a least one among them. If $a < b$, where $b$ is that least one, then $a \le f(a)$; it follows, in particular, with $a = f(b)$, that $f(b) \le f(f(b))$. Since, however, $f(b) < b$, the order-preserving character of $f$ implies that $f(f(b)) < f(b)$. The only way out of the contradiction is to admit the impossibility of $f(b) < b$. 

The result of the preceding paragraph has three especially useful consequences. The first of these is the fact that if two well ordered sets, $X$ and $Y$ say, are similar at all, then there is just one similarity between them. Suppose indeed that both $g$ and $h$ are similarities $X$ onto $Y$, write $f = g^{-1}h$. Since $f$ is a similarity of $X$ onto itself; it follows that $a \le f(a)$ for each $a$ in $X$. This means that $a \le g^{-1}(h(a))$ for each $a$ in $X$. Applying $g$, we infer that $g(a) \le h(a)$ for each $a$ in $X$. The situation is symmetric in $g$ and $h$, so that we may also infer that $h(a) \le g(a)$ for each $a$ in $X$. Conclusion: $g = h$.
