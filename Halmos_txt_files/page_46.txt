ZC. FUNCTIONS 33 bserve that there is gome method in thig apparent madness; the number elements in the sets 0, 1, or 2 (in the ordinary every- gense of the ord) is, respectively, zero, one, or two If A is & subset of & set X, the characteristic function of A is the function X to 2 such that x(z) = 1 or 0 according &s > € 4 Or I €X _ A. he dependence of the characteristic function of on the set may be dicated by writing XA instead of X: The function that assigns to each bset A of X (that is, to each element of P(X)) the characteristic function A (that is an element of 2X) is one-to-one correspondence between (Y) and 2* (Parenthetically : instead of the phrase "the function that signs to each A in P(X) the element X4 in 2Xv it is customary to use the breviation "the function XA: In this language, the projection om X X Y onto X, for instance, may be called the function (x, y) 1d the canonical map from set X with relation R onto X/R may be lled the function I/R.) ExERCISE () YZ has exactly one element, namely ?, whether Y is empty O not; and (i) if X is not empty, then GX is empty. Original Mom ed by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN day from
