Observe that there is some method in this apparent madness; the number of elements in the sets $0$, $1$, or $2$ (in the ordinary everyday sense of the word) is, respectively, zero, one, or two.

If $A$ is a subset of a set $X$, the \textit{characteristic function} of $A$ is the function $x$ from $X$ to $2$ such that $\chi (x) = 1$ or $0$ according as $x \in A$ or $x \in X - A$. The dependence of the characteristic function of $A$ on the set $A$ may be indicated by writing $\chi_{A}$ instead of $\chi$. The function that assigns to each subset $A$ of $X$ (that is, to each element of $\mathcal{P}(X)$) the characteristic function of $A$ (that is an element of $2^{X}$) is a one-to-one correspondence between $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and $2^{X}$ (Parenthetically: instead of the phrase "the function that assigns to each $A$ in $\mathcal{P}(X)$ the element $\chi_{A}$ in $2^{X}$" it is customary to use the abbreviation "the function A \rightarrow \chi{A}$." In this language, the projection from $X \times Y$ onto $X$, for instance, may be called the function $(x, y) \rightarrow x", and the canonical map from set $X$ with a relation $R$ onto $X/R$ may be called the function $ x \rightarrow x/R$.)
