If, conversely, $X \prec \omega$, then $X$ must be finite, for otherwise we should have $\omega \precsim X$, hence $\omega \prec \omega$, which is absurd. 

A set $X$ is called \textit{countable} (or \textit{denumerable}) in case $X \precsim \omega$ and \textit{countably infinite} in case $X \sim \omega$. Clearly a countable set is either finite or countably infinite. Our main purpose in the immediate sequel is to show that many set-theoretic constructions when performed on countable sets lead again to countable sets. 

We begin with the observation that every subset of $\omega$ is countable, and we go on to deduce that every subset of each countable set is countable. These facts are trivial but useful. 

If $f$ is a function from $\omega$ \textit{onto} a set $X$, then $X$ is countable. For the proof, observe that for each $x$ in $X$ the set $f^{-1}(\{ x \})$ is not empty (this is where the \textit{onto} character of $f$ is important), and consequently, for each $x$ in $X$, we may find a natural number $g(x)$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$. Since the function $g$ is a one-to-one mapping from $X$ into $\omega$, this proves that $X \precsim \omega$. The reader who worries about such things might have noticed that this proof made use of the axiom of choice, and he may want to know that there is an alternative proof that does not depend on that axiom. (There is.) The same comment applies on a few other occasions in this section and its successors but we shall refrain from making it. 

It follows from the preceding paragraph that a set $X$ is countable if and only if there exists a function from some countable set onto $X$. A closely related result is this: if $Y$ is any particular countably infinite set, then a necessary and sufficient condition that a non-empty set $X$ be countable is that there exist a function $Y$ onto $X$. 

The mapping $n \rightarrow 2n$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $\omega$ and the set $A$ of all even numbers, so that $A$ is countably infinite. This implies that if $X$ is a countable set, then there exists a function $f$ that maps $A$ onto $X$. Since, similarly, the mapping $n \rightarrow 2n + 1$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $\omega$ and the set $B$ of all odd numbers, it follows that if $Y$ is a countable set, then there exists a function $g$ that maps $B$ onto $Y$. The function $h$ that agrees with $f$ on $A$ and with $g$ on $B$ (i.e., h(x) = f(x) when $x \in A$ and $h(x) = g(x)$ when $x \in B$) maps $\omega$ onto $X \cup Y$. Conclusion: the union of two countable sets is countable: From here on an easy argument by mathematical induction proves that the union of a finite set of countable sets is countable. The same result can be obtained by imitating the trick that worked for two sets; the bagis of the method is the fact that for each non-zero natural number $n$ there exists a pairwise disjoint family $\{ A_{i} \} (i < n)$ of infinite subsets of $\omega$ whose union is equal to $\omega$. 

The same method can be used to prove still more. Assertion: there
