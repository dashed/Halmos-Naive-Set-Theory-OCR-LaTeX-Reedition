23 COUNTABLE SETS conversely, X < W, then X must be finite, for otherwise we ghould have <X, hence 0, which i8 absurd: A set X is called countable (Or denumerable) in case X < @ and countably finite in case X Clearly & countable get is either finite or countably inite. Our main purpose in the immediate gequel is to ghow that many t-theoretic constructions when performed on countable sets lead again to untable Bets We begin with the observation that every subset of @ is countable, and g0 on to deduce that every subset of each countable get is countable. ese facts are trivial but useful. If f is & function from W onto & get X, then X ig countable For the proof, serve that for each z in X the f-'({c}) is not empty (this is where onto character of f is important), and consequently, for each < in X, we y find a natural number g(x) such that f(g()) Since the function one-to-one mapping from X into @, thig proves that X<0 The der who worries about such thingg might have noticed that this proof 1de use of the axiom of ~choice, and he may want to know that there is alternative proof that does not depend on that axiom. (There is.) The me comment on few other occasiong in this gection its ccessors but we ghall refrain making it_ It follows from the preceding paragraph that & get X is countable if and ly if there exists function some countable get onto X_ A closely ated result is this: if Y is any particular countably infinite get, then cessary and sufficient condition that & non-empty get X be countable is at there exist & function Y onto X_ The mapping n 2n j8 & one-to-one correspondence between and set A of all even numbers, s0 that A ig countably infinite. Thig implies at if X ig & countable get then there exists & function f that maps to X Since, similarly, the mapping n 2n + 1 is & one-to-one cOr- spondence between and the get B of all odd numbers, it followg that if is & countable set, then there exists function g that mapg B onto Y_ le function h that agrees with f on A and with g on B (i.e-, h(z) f(z) len I â‚¬ A and h(c) g(c) when B) map8 onto X U Y Conclu- : the union of two countable sets ig countable: From here on an easy gument by mathematical induction proves that the union of & finite get countable sets is countable. The game result can be obtained by imitat- 5 the trick that worked for two gets; the bagig of the method is the fact at for each non-zero natural number n there exists pairwise disjoint nily {A;} <n) of infinite gubsetg of W whoge union is to @.
