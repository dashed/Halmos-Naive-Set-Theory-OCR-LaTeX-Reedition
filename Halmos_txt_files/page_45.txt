32 NAIVE_SET THEORY SEc: 8 restriction of f to X, and f is called an eztension of g to Y; it ig customary to write g f X The definition of restriction can be expressed by writing (f | X)(z) f(z) for each r in X; observe also that ran (f | X) = f(X)_ The inclusion map of & gubset of Y is the restriction to that gubset of the identity map on Y Here is simple but useful example of function Consider any two sets X and Y, and define function f from X X Y oto X by writing f(z,y) (The purist  will have noted that we should have  written f((z, y)) instead of f(z, y), but nobody ever does:) The function f is called the projeclion from X X Y onto X; if, similarly, g(z, y) Y, then g i8 the projection from X X Y onto Y. The terminology here is at variance with an earlier one, but not badly. If R XX Y, then what was earlier called the projection of R onto the first coordinate is, in the present lan- guage, the range of the projection f: more complicated and correspondingly more valuable example of & function can be obtained as follows   Suppose R ig an equivalence relation in X, and let f be the function from X onto X/R defined by f(z) r/R_ The function f is sometimes called the canonical map from X to X/R. If f is an arbitrary function, from X onto Y, then there is & natural way of defining an equivalence relation R in X; write a R b (where @ and b are in X) in case f(a) f()_ For each element y of Y, let g(y) be the set of all those elements  in X for which f(c) The definition of R implies that g(y) is, for each y, an equivalence class of the relation R; in other words, g is & function from Y onto the set X/R of all equivalence classes of R. The function 9 has the following special property: if u and are distinct elements of Y, then g(u) and g(v) are distinct elements of X/R_ A function that always maps distinct elements oto distinct elements is called one-to-one (usually a one-to-one correspondence)_ Among the exam- ples above the inclusion maps are one- to-one, but, except in gome trivial special cases, the projections are not_ (Exercise what special cases?) To introduce the next aspect of the elementary of functions we must digress for & moment and anticipate tiny fragment of our ultimate definition of natural numbers: We shall not find it necessary to define &ll the natural numbers now; all we need is the first three of them Since this is not the appropriate occasion for lengthy heuristic prelimingries, we shall proceed directly to the definition, even at the risk of temporarily ghocking or worrying gome readers. Here it is: we define 0, 1, and 2 by writing 0 = 0, {81, and 2 = {0,{0}}: In other words, 0 ig empty, 1 ig the singleton {0} , and 2 is the {0, 1}.
