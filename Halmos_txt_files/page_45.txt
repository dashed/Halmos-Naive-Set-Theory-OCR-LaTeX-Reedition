\textit{restriction} of $f$ to $X$, and $f$ is called an \textit{extension} of $g$ to $Y$; it is customary to write $g = f|X$. The definition of restriction can be expressed by writing $(f|X)(x) = f(x)$ for each $x$ in $X$; observe also that ran $(f|X) = f(X)$. The inclusion map of a subset of $Y$ is the restriction to that subset of the identity map on $Y$. 

Here is a simple but useful example of a function. Consider any two sets $X$ and $Y$, and define function $f$ from $X \times Y$ onto $X$ by writing $f(x,y) = x$. (The purist  will have noted that we should have written $f((x, y))$ instead of $f(x, y)$, but nobody ever does.) The function $f$ is called the \textit{projection} from $X \times Y$ onto $X$; if, similarly, $g(x, y) = y$, then $g$ is the projection from $X \times Y$ onto $Y$. The terminology here is at variance with an earlier one, but not badly. If $R = X \times Y$, then what was earlier called the projection of $R$ onto the first coordinate is, in the present language, the range of the projection $f$.

A more complicated and correspondingly more valuable example of a function can be obtained as follows. Suppose $R$ is an equivalence relation in $X$, and let $f$ be the function from $X$ onto $X/R$ defined by $f(x) = x/R$. The function $f$ is sometimes called the \textit{canonical map} from $X$ to $X/R$.

If $f$ is an arbitrary function, from $X$ onto $Y$, then there is a natural way of defining an equivalence relation $R$ in $X$; write $a R b$ (where $a$ and $b$ are in $X$) in case $f(a) = f(b)$. For each element $y$ of $Y$, let $g(y)$ be the set of all those elements $x$ in $X$ for which $f(x) = y$. The definition of $R$ implies that $g(y)$ is, for each $y$, an equivalence class of the relation $R$; in other words, $g$ is a function from $Y$ onto the set $X/R$ of all equivalence classes of $R$. The function $g$ has the following special property: if $u$ and $v$ are distinct elements of $Y$, then $g(u)$ and $g(v)$ are distinct elements of $X/R$. A function that always maps distinct elements onto distinct elements is called \textit{one-to-one} (usually a \textit{one-to-one correspondence}). Among the examples above the inclusion maps are one-to-one, but, except in some trivial special cases, the projections are not. (Exercise: what special cases?)

To introduce the next aspect of the elementary of functions we must digress for a moment and anticipate a tiny fragment of our ultimate definition of natural numbers. We shall not find it necessary to define all the natural numbers now; all we need is the first three of them. Since this is not the appropriate occasion for lengthy heuristic preliminaries, we shall proceed directly to the definition, even at the risk of temporarily shocking or worrying some readers. Here it is: we define  $0$, $1$, and $2$ by writing 

\begin{equation*}
0 = \emptyset , \: 1=\{ \emptyset \} , \: \text{and} \: 2 = \{ \emptyset , \{ \emptyset \} \} . 
\end{equation*}

In other words, $0$ is empty, $1$ is the singleton $\{ 0 \}$, and $2$ is the pair $ \{ 0, 1 \}$.
