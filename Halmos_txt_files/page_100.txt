22 THE SCHRODER-BERNSTEIN  THEOREM 87 namely , their ordinal number. Do these two remarkg golve the To compare the gizes of X and Y, may we just well order each of and then compare ord X and ord Y? The angwer j8 most emphati- no. The trouble is that one and the game set can be well ordered in y way8. The ordinal number of & well ordered get measures the well ring more than it measures the get: For & concrete example consider et @ of all natural numbers. Introduce & new order by placing 0 after ything else. (In other words, if n and m are non-zero natural num- then arrange them in their ugual order; if, however, n 0 and m 7 0, precede n ) The result is & well ordering of w; the ordinal number of well ordering is w + X end Y are well ordered gets, then & necessary and guffcient condi- that ord X Y is that X be similar to an initial segment of Y_ llowg that we could compare the ordinal gizes of two well ordered gets without knowing anything about ordinal numbers; &ll we need Ow is the concept of similarity . Similarity was defined for ordered the central concept for arbitrary unordered sets is that of equivalence  all that two gets X and Y are called equivalent, X Y,in case there 8 & one-to-one correspondence between them.) we replace similar- y equivalence, then something like the suggestion of the preceding graph becomes usable_ The i8 that we do not have to know size i8 if all we want is to compare sizes X and Y are gete such that X is equivalent to & subset of Y, we shall x<Y. notation ig temporary and does not deserve & permanent name As 88 it lagt8, however, it is convenient to have & way of referring to it; & nable possibility i8 to gay that Y dominates X_ The set of those Or - 1 pairs (X, Y) of subsets of some set E for which X < Y constitutes & ion in the power set of E.
