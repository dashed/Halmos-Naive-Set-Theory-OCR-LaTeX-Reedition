size, namely, their ordinal number. Do these two remarks solve the problem? To compare the sizes of $X$ and $Y$, may we just well order each of them and then compare ord $X$ and ord $Y$? The answer is most emphatically no. The trouble is that one and the same set can be well ordered in many ways. The ordinal number of a well ordered set measures the well ordering more than it measures the set. For a concrete example consider the set $\omega$ of all natural numbers. Introduce a new order by placing $0$ after everything else. (In other words, if $n$ and $m$ are non-zero natural numbers, then arrange them in their usual order; if, however, $n = 0$ and $m \neq 0$, let $m$ precede $n$.) The result is a well ordering of $\omega$; the ordinal number of this well ordering is $\omega + 1$.

If $X$ and $Y$ are well ordered sets, then a necessary and sufficient condition that ord $X <$ ord $Y$ is that $X$ be similar to an initial segment of $Y$. It follows that we could compare the ordinal sizes of two well ordered sets even without knowing anything about ordinal numbers; all we need to know is the concept of similarity. Similarity was defined for ordered sets; the central concept for arbitrary unordered sets is that of equivalence. (Recall that two sets $X$ and $Y$ are called equivalent, $X \sim Y$, in case there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them.) If we replace similarity by equivalence, then something like the suggestion of the preceding paragraph becomes usable. The point is that we do not have to know what size is if all we want is to compare sizes. 

If $X$ and $Y$ are sets such that $X$ is equivalent to a subset of $Y$, we shall write 

\begin{equation*}
X \presim Y. 
\end{equation*}

The notation is temporary and does not deserve a permanent name. As long as it lasts, however, it is convenient to have a way of referring to it; a reasonable possibility is to say that $Y$ \textit{dominates} $X$. The set of those ordered pairs $(X, Y)$ of subsets of some set $E$ for which $X \presim Y$ constitutes a relation in the power set of $E$. The symbolism correctly suggests some of the properties of the concept that it denotes. Since the symbolism is reminiscent of partial orders, and since a partial order is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, we may expect   that domination has similar properties. 

Reflexivity and transitivity cause no trouble. Since each set $X$ is equivalent to a subset (namely, $X$) of itself, it follows that $X \presim X$ for all $X$. If $f$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $X$ and subset of $Y$, and if $g$ is a one-to-one correspondence between $Y$ and a subset of $Z$, then we may restrict $g$ to the range of $f$ and compound the result with $f$; the
