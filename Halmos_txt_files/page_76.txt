upper bound. Just exactly when and how all this comes to an end is obscure, to say the least. There is no help for it; we must look at the precise proof. The structure of the proof is an adaptation of one originally given by Zermelo. 

Proof. The first step is to replace the abstract partial ordering by the inclusion order in a suitable collection of sets. More precisely, we consider, for each element $x$ in $X$, the weak initial segment $\bar{s}(x)$ consisting of $x$ and all its predecessors. The range $\mathcal{S}$ of the function $\bar{s}$ (from $X$ to $\mathcal{P}(X)$) is a certain collection of subsets of $X$, which we may, of course, regard as (partially) ordered by inclusion. The function $\bar{s}$ is one-to-one, and a necessary and sufficient condition that $\bar{s}(x) \subset \bar{s}(y)$ is that $x \le y$. In view of this, the task of finding a maximal element in $X$ is the same as the task of finding a maximal set in $\mathcal{S}$. The hypothesis about chains in $X$ implies (and is, fact, equivalent to) the corresponding statement about chains in $\mathcal{S}$. 

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be the set of all chains in $X$; every member of $\mathcal{X}$ is included in $\bar{S}(x)$ for some $x$ in $X$. The collection $\mathcal{X}$ is a non-empty collection of sets, partially ordered by inclusion, and such that if $\mathcal{C}$ is a chain in $\mathcal{X}$, then the union of the sets in $\mathcal{C}$ (i.e., \bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{C}} A$) belongs to $\mathcal{X}$. Since each set in $\mathcal{X}$ is dominated by some set in $\mathcal{S}$, the passage from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{X}$ cannot introduce any new maximal elements. One advantage of the collection $\mathcal{X}$ is the slightly more specific form that the chain hypothesis assumes; instead of saying at each chain $\mathcal{C}$ has some upper bound in $\mathcal{S}$, we can say explicitly that the union of the sets of $\mathcal{C}$, which is clearly an upper bound of $\mathcal{C}$, is an element of the collection $\mathcal{X}$. Another technical advantage of $\mathcal{X}$ is that it contains all the subsets of each of its sets; this makes it possible to enlarge non-maximal sets in X$\mathcal{X}$ slowly, one element at a time. 

Now we can forget about the given partial order in $X$. In what follows we consider a non-empty collection $\mathcal{X}$ of subsets of a non-empty set $X$, subject to two conditions: every subset of each set in $\mathcal{X}$ is in $\mathcal{X}$, and the union of each chain of sets in $\mathcal{X}$ is in $\mathcal{X}$. Note that the first condition implies that $\emptyset \in \mathcal{X}$. Our task is to prove that there exists in $\mathcal{X}$ a maximal set. 

Let $f$ be a choice function for $X$ to $X$, that is, $f$ is a function from the collection of all non-empty subsets of $X$ to $X$ such that $f(A) \in A$ for all $A$ in the domain of $f$. For each set $A$ in $\mathcal{X}$, let $\hat{A}$ be the set of all those elements $x$ of $X$ whose adjunction to $A$ produces a set in $\mathcal{X}$; in other words, $\hat{A}$ =\{ x \in X:A \cup \{ x \} \in \mathcal{X} \}$. Define a function $g$ from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{X}$ as follows: if $\hat{A} - A \neq \emptyset $, then $g(A) = A \cup \{ f( \hat{A} - A) \}$; if $\hat{A} - A = \emptyset$, then $g(A) = A$. It follows from the definition of $\hat{A}$ that $\hat{A} - A = \emptyset$ if and only if $A$ is maximal. In these terms, therefore, what we must prove is that there exists in $\mathcal{X}$ a set $A$ such that $g(A) = A$. It turns out that the crucial property
