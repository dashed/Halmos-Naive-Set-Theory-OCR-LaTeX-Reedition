C. 16 ORNS LEMMA 03 per bound. Just exactly when and how all this comeg to an end i8 0b- ure, to gay the least. There is no help for it; we must look at the precise oof. The gtructure of the proof i8 an adaptation of one originally given Zermelo. PROoF The first is to replace the abstract partial ordering by the clusion order in & suitable collection of sets More precisely , we consider, each element € in X, the weak initial segment 3(.) consisting of € and its predecessors: The range $ of the function 3 (from X to P(X)) is & rtain collection of subsets of X, which we of course, a8 (par- lly) ordered by inclusion. The function $ is one-to-one, and necessary d gufficient condition that s(c) € s(y) is that € & y. In view of this, task of finding & maximal element in X is the same &8 the task of find- 3 & maximal set in &. The hypothesis about chains in X implies (and is, fact, equivalent to) the corresponding statement about chains in $ Let % be the set of all chains in X; every member of % is included in c) for gome € in X. The collection x is & non-empty collection of gets, rtially ordered by inclusion, and such that if @ is & chain in T, then the ion of the gets in @ (i.e , UA< A) belongs to & Since each set in % is minated by some set in $, the passage from $ to & cannot introduce any w maximal elements. One advantage of the collection & is the slightly ore specific form that the chain hypothesis assumes; instead of saying at each chain @ has gome upper bound in 8, we can say explicitly that union of the gets of @, which is clearly an upper bound of @, is an ele- ent of the collection &. Another technical advantage of & is that it con - ins &ll the gubsets of each of its gets; this makes it possible to enlarge n-maximal gets in X slowly, one element &t & time. Now we can forget about the given partial order in X. In what follows consider a non-empty collection T of subsets of & non-empty set X, bject to two conditions- every subset of each set in I is in %, and the ion of each chain of sets in & is in % Note that the first condition im- les that $ I. Our task is to prove that there exists in & & maximal set. Let f be & choice function for X, that is, f is & function from the collection all non-empty subgets of X to X such that f(A) € A for &ll A in the main of f. For each set A in %, let ^ be the set of all those elements of X whose adjunction to produces & set in &; in other words, ^ X:A U {c} x} Define & function g from % to % a8 follows: if A 7$,then g(A) A U {f(^ A)} ; if ^ 0,then g(A) follows from the definition of A that ^ 0 if and only if A i8 aximal. In these terms, therefore, what we must prove is that there ists in % & set A guch that 9(A) It turns out that the crucial prop- Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN step regard mey ,
