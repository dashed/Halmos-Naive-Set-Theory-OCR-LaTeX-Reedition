17 WELL ORDERING re $ = X Equivalently: if the presence in get of &ll the strict ssor8 of an element alwayg implies the presence of the element itself , n the set must contain everything few remarks are in order before we look at the proof: The gtatement the ordinary principle of mathematical induction differs from that of nsfinite induction in two conspicuous regpects. One: the latter, instead passing to each element its predecessor _ passes to each element n the get of all its predecessorg Two: in the latter there is no assump- about & starting element (such &8 zero)_ The firgt difference is impor- t: an element in & well ordered get may fail to have an immediate pred- SsOr _ The present statement when applied to @ is easily proved to be ivalent to the principle of mathematical  induction; that   principle, vever; when applied to an arbitrary well ordered set, i8 not equivalent the principle of transfinite induction To it differently = tbe two tements are in general not equivalent to each other; their equivalence i8 & but gpecial circumstance. Iere is an example Let X be w X U {6} Define order in y ordering the elements of w &9 usual and by requiring that n < for n in The result is well ordered get  Question: does there exist per subset $ of X such that 0 € $ and such that n + 1 € $ whenever S? Angwer: yes, namely $ = Che second difference between ordinary induction and transfinite induc- (no starting element required for the latter) is more linguistic than ceptual: If To is the gmallest element of X, then s(zo) is empty, and, sequently, s(xo) € S; the hypothesis of the principle of transfinite in- tion requires therefore that To belong to S. The proof of the principle of transfinite induction is almost trivial. S is not empty, then it has & smallest element, say This implies element of the initial segment s(z) belongs to $, hence, by induction hypothesis, that belongs to S. This is contradiction cannot to both S and X 8) ; the conclusion is that X S is pty after all. Ve shall say that & well ordered set A is & continuation of & well ordered B, if, in the first place, B is & gubset of A, if, in fact, B is an initial seg- nt of A, and if; finally, the ordering of the elements in B is the sme as ir ordering in A_ Thus if X is & well ordered and if a and b are ele- nts of X with b < a, then s(a) is & continuation of s(b), and, of course, s & continuation of both s(a) and s(b) @ i8 an arbitrary collection of initial segments of & well ordered set, n @ is & chain with respect to continuation; this meang that @ is & collec- Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN pred- from put beppy ie , and every belong set
