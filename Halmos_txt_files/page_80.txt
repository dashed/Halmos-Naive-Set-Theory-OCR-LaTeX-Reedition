have $S = X$. Equivalently: if the presence in a set of all the strict predecessors of an element always implies the presence of the element itself, then the set must contain everything. 

A few remarks are in order before we look at the proof. The statement of the ordinary principle of mathematical induction differs from that of transfinite induction in two conspicuous respects. One: the latter, instead of passing to each element from its predecessor, passes to each element from the set of all its predecessors. Two: in the latter there is no assumption about a starting element (such as zero). The first difference is important: an element in a well ordered set may fail to have an immediate predecessor. The present statement when applied to $\omega$ is easily proved to be equivalent to the principle of mathematical induction; that principle, however, when applied to an arbitrary well ordered set, is not equivalent to the principle of transfinite induction. To put it differently: the two statements are in general not equivalent to each other; their equivalence in $\omega$ is a happy but special circumstance. 

Here is an example. Let $X$ be $\omega^{+}$, i.e., $X = \omega \cup \{ \omega \}$. Define order in $X$ by ordering the elements of $\omega$ as usual and by requiring that $n < \omega$ for all $n$ in $\omega$. The result is a well ordered set. Question: does there exist a proper subset $S$ of $X$ such that $0 \in S$ and such that $n + 1 \in  S$ whenever $n \in S$? Angwer: yes, namely $S = \omega$. 

The second difference between ordinary induction and transfinite induction (no starting element required for the latter) is more linguistic than conceptual. If $x_{0}$ is the smallest element of $X$, then $s(x_{0})$ is empty, and, consequently, $s(x_{0}) \subset S$; the hypothesis of the principle of transfinite induction requires therefore that $x_{0}$ belong to $S$.

The proof of the principle of transfinite induction is almost trivial. If $X - S$ is not empty, then it has a smallest element, say $x$. This implies that every element of the initial segment $s(x)$ belongs to $S$, and hence, by the induction hypothesis, that $x$ belongs to $S$. This is a contradiction ($x$ cannot to both $S$ and $X - S$); the conclusion is that $X - S$ is empty after all. 

We shall say that a well ordered set $A$ is a \textit{continuation} of a well ordered set $B$, if, in the first place, $B$ is a subset of $A$, if, in fact, $B$ is an initial segment of $A$, and if, finally, the ordering of the elements in $B$ is the same as their ordering in $A$. Thus if $X$ is a well ordered set and if $a$ and $b$ are elements of $X$ with $b < a$, then $s(a)$ is a continuation of $s(b)$, and, of course, $X$ is a continuation of both $s(a)$ and $s(b)$. 

If $\mathcal{C}$ is an arbitrary collection of initial segments of a well ordered set, then $\mathcal{C}$ is a chain with respect to continuation; this means that $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection
