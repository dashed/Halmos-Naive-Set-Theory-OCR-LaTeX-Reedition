\chapter{SECTION 17: WELL ORDERING}

A pertially ordered may not have a smallest element, and, even if it has one, it is perfectly possible that some subset will fail to have one. A partially ordered set is called \textit{well ordered} (and its ordering is called a \textit{well ordering}) if every non-empty subset of it has a smallest element. One consequence of this definition, worth noting even before we look at any examples and counterexamples, is that every well ordered set is totally ordered. Indeed, if $x$ and $y$ are elements of a well ordered set, then $\{ x,y \}$ is a non-empty subset of that well ordered set and has therefore a first element; according as that first element is $x$ or $y$, we have $x \le y$ or $y \le x$.

For each natural number $n$, the set of all predecessors of $n$ (that is, in accordance with our definitions, the set $n$) is a well ordered set (ordered by magnitude), and the same is true of the set $\omega$ of all natural numbers. The set $\omega \times \omega $, with $(a,b) \le (x,y)$ defined to mean $(2a + 1)2^{y} \le (2x + 1)2^{b}$ is not well ordered. One way to see this is to note that $(a,b + 1) \le (a,b)$ for all $a$ and $b$; it follows that the entire set $\omega \times \omega$ has no least element. Some subsets of $\omega \times \omega$ do have a least element. Consider, for example, the set $E$ of all those pairs $(a, b)$ for which $(1,1) \le (a,b)$; the set $E$ has $(1, 1)$ for its least element. Caution: $E$, considered as a partially ordered set on its own right, is still not well ordered. The trouble is that even though $E$ has a least element, many subsets of $E$ fail to have one; for an example consider the set of all those pairs $(a,b)$ in $E$ for which $(a,b) \neq (1, 1)$. One more example: $\omega \times \omega$ is well ordered by its lexicographical ordering. 

One of the pleasantest facts about well ordered sets is that we can prove about their elements by process similar to mathematical induction. Precisely speaking, suppose that $S$ is a subset of well ordered set $X$, and suppose that whenever an element $x$ of $X$ is such that the entire initial segment $s(x)$ is included in $S$, then $x$ itself belongs to $S$; the \textbf{principle of transfinite induction} asserts that under these circumstances we must
