that none of the methods of set construction that we have seen so far is sufficiently strong to prove the existence of a set $F$ of ordered pairs such that $(n, x) \in F$ if and only if $x \in F(n)$. To achieve this obviously desirable state of affairs, we need one more set-theoretic principle (our last). The new principle says, roughly speaking, that anything intelligent that one can do to the elements of a set yields a set.

\begin{named}[Axiom of substitution. ] If $S(a,b)$ is a sentence such that for each $a$ in a set $A$ the set $\{ b: S(a, b) \}$ can be formed, then there exists a function $F$ with domain $A$ such that $F(a) = \{ b: S(a,b) \} $ for each $a$ in $A$.
\end{named}

To say that $\{ b: S(a,b) \} $ can be formed means, of course, that there exists a set $F(a)$ such that $b \in F(a)$ if and only if $S(a,b)$ is true. The axiom of extension implies that the function described in the axiom of substitution is uniquely determined by the given sentence and the given set. The reaaon for the name of the axiom is that it enables us to make a new set out an old one by substituting something new for each element of the old. 

The chief application of the axiom of substitution is in extending the process of counting far beyond the natural numbers. From the present point of view, the crucial property of a natural number is that it is a well ordered set such that the initial segment determined by each element is equal to that element. (Recall that if $m$ and $n$ are natural numbers, then $m < n$ means $m \in n$; this implies that ${\ m \in \omega : m <n \} = n$.) This is the property on which the extended counting process is based; the fundamental definition in this circle of ideas is due von Neumann. An \textit{ordinal number} is defined as a well ordered set $\alpha$ such that $s( xi ) = \xi$ for all $\xi $ in $\alpha$; here $s( \xi )$ is, as before, the initial segment $\{ \eta \in \alpha: \eta < \i \} $.

An example of an ordinal number that is not a natural number is the set $\omega$ consisting of all the natural numbers. This means that we can already "count" farther than we could before; whereas before the only numbers at our disposal were the elements of $\omega$, now we have $\omega$ itself. We have also the successor $ \omega^{+}$ of $\omega$; this set is ordered in the obvious way, and, moreover, the obvious ordering is a well ordering that satisfies the condition imposed on ordinal numbers. Indeed, if $\xi \in \omega^{+}$, then, by the definition of successor, either $\xi \in \omega$, in which case we already know that $s( \xi ) = \xi$, or else $ \xi = \omega$, in which case $s( \xi ) =  \omega$, by the definition of order, so that again $s( \xi ) = \xi$. The argument just presented is quite general; it proves at if $\alpha$ is an ordinal number, then so is $\alpha^{+}$. It follows that our counting ptocess extends now up to and including $\omega$, and $\omega^{+}$ and $(\omega{+})^{+}$, and so on ad infinitum.
