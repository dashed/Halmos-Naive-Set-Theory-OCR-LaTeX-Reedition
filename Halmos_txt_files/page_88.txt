c. 19 ORDINAL NUMBERS 75 er; that none of the methods of get construction that we have geen BO i8 8ufficiently strong to prove' the existence of & get F of ordered pairg ch that (n, ) F if and only if x F(n). To achieve this obviously de- able state of affairg, we need one more get-theoretic principle (our last). le new principle 8ay8, roughly speaking, that anything intelligent that e can do to the elements of & get yields 8 get_ Axiom of gubetitution. If S(a,6) i8 & sentence such that for each @ in & set A the set {b: S(a, 6) } can be formed, then there exists a function F with domain A such that F(a) {b: S(a,6) } for each a in A. To say that {b: S(a, 6) } can be formed means, of course, that there exigts get F(a) guch that b F(a) if and only if S(a,b) ig true. The axiom of tension that the function degcribed in the axiom of gubetitution uniquely determined by the given sentence and the given get. The rea - for the name of the axiom i8 that it enables u8 to make & new set out an old one by substituting Bomething new for each element of the old: The chief application of the axiom of gubstitution ig in extending the ocess of counting fer beyond the natural number8. From the present int of view, the crucial property of & natural number is thet it i8 & well dered set such that the initial segment determined by each element is ual to that element (Recall that if m and n are natural numbers, then nmeang n; this implies that {m W:m <n) n.) This is the operty on which the extended counting process is based; the fundamen- definition in this circle of ideas is due von Neumann. An ordinal mber is defined as & well ordered set & guch that s(e) ;ior all / in &; re s(E) i9, &8 before; the initial segment {v a:9 < #}- An example of an ordinal number that is not & natural number i8 the consisting of &ll the natural numbers This means that we can &]- ady "count" farther  than we  could   before; wherees   before the only mbers &t our disposal were the elements of @, now we have w itself. We ve also the successor @ + of W; thig set ig ordered in the obvioug way, &nd; oreover, the obvioug ordering is & well ordering that gatisfies the condi- on imposed on ordinal numbers.
