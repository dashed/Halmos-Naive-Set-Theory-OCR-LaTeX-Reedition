DD_ TDOn 1 DEC - The reletion between (+) and (*) typifies gomething that occurs quite frequently. All the remaining principles of get construction are pseudo special cases of the axiom of gpecification in the gense in which (#) is pseudo-gpecial case of (#*). all assert the existence of & set 8pecified by & certain condition; if it were known in advance that there exists & set containing &ll the specified elements, then the existence of & get containing just them would indeed follow &8 & special case of the axiom of specificetion_ If a i8 8et, we may form the unordered {a, a}. That unordered ig denoted by {a} and i8 called the singleton of a; it is uniquely characterized by the state- ment that it has a8 its only element_ Thus, for instance, $ and {2} are different sets; the former has no elements, whereas the latter has the unique element 0. To sy that a € A is equivalent to saying that {a} € A. The axiom of pairing ensures that every set is an element of some set and that any two sets are simultaneously elements of gome one and the Bame get_ (The corresponding questions for three and four and more sets will be angwered later.) Another pertinent comment is that from the as- sumptions we have made g0 far we can infer the existence of very many sets indeed. For examples  consider the sets 0, {8}, {{8}}, {{{8}}} etc: ; consider the pairs, guch {0,{S} , formed by any two of them; consider the pairg formed by any two such pair8, Or else the mixed pairs formed by any singleton and any and proceed g0 on ad infinitum. ExERCISE Are all the sets obtained in  this way distinct from one another? Before continuing our study of set theory, we pause for & moment to discuss & notational matter_ It seems natural to denote the get B described in (+) by {z: S()} in the case that was there considered {r:I a Or z = 6} {a, 6} We ghall use thig gymbolism whenever it ig convenient and permissible to do g0. If, that is, S(z) is & condition on < such that the z's that S(z) speci- fies constitute & set, then we may denote that set by {z: S(2)} . In case A is & get and S(z) is (x € 4), then it is permissible to form {z: S(z)} ; in fact {r:z€ A} = A3 Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN They pair pair very pair; special
