NANYD DEI TnLUR1 DEC_ exists & pairwise disjoint family {An} (n w) of infinite subsets of w whose union is to @. One way to prove this is to write down the elements of w in &n infinite array by counting down the diagonals; thus: 10 15 16 8 1 17 19 20 and then to consider the sequence of the rows of this array: Another way is to let Ao consist of 0 the odd number8, let A, be the obtained by doubling each non-zero element of Ao, &nd, inductively, let be the obtained by doubling each element of 21. Either way (and there are many others still) the details are easy to fill in. Conclusion : the union of & countably infinite family of countable sets is countable Proof : given the family (Xa} (n w) of countable set8, find & family {fz} of func- tions guch that, for each the function f, maps An onto Xn, and define function f irom w onto Un Xn by writing f(k) fn(k) whenever k An: This result combined with the result of the preceding paragraph implies that the union of & countable set of countable sets is always countable_ An interesting end useful corollary is that the Cartesian product of two countable gets ig also countable. Since xxY = Uver (XX (y}), since, if X is countable; then, for each fixed y in Y, the set X X {y} is obviously countable (use the one-to-one correspondence (1,y)), the result follows the preceding paragraph: ExERCISE. Prove that the get of &ll finite gubsets of & countable set is countable_ Prove that if countable subset of totally  ordered set X is well ordered, then X itself is well ordered: On the basis of the preceding discussion it would not be unreasonable to guess that every get is countable: We proceed to show that that is not 80; this negative regult is wbat makeg the theory of cardinal numbers interesting Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN equal and set An+l Av set and from every
