exists a pairwise disjoint family $\{ A_{n} \} (n \in \omega)$ of infinite subsets of $\omega$ whose union is equal to $\omega$. One way to prove this is to write down the elements of $\omega$ in an infinite array by counting down the diagonals; thus: 

\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}
$0$ & $1$ & $2$ & $3$ & $6$ & $10$ & $15$ & $\cdots$  \\
$2$ & $4$ & $7$ & $11$ & $16$ & $\cdots$ & & \\
$5$ & $8$ & $12$ & $17$ & $\cdots$ & & & \\
$9$ & $13$ & $18$ & $\cdots & & & & \\
$14$ & $19$ & $\cdots$ & & & & & \\
$20$ & $\cdots$ & & & & & & \\
$\cdots$ & & & & & & & 
\end{tabular}

and then to consider the sequence of the rows of this array. Another way is to let $A_{0}$ consist of 0 and the odd numbers, let $A_{1}$, be the set obtained by doubling each non-zero element of $A_{0}$, and, inductively, let $A_{n+1}$ be the set obtained by doubling each element of $A_{n}, n \ge 1$. Either way (and there are many others still) the details are easy to fill in. Conclusion: the union of a countably infinite family of countable sets is countable. Proof: given the family $\{ X_{n} \} (n \in \omega)$ of countable sets, find a family $\{ f_{n} \}$ of functions such that, for each $n$, the function $f_{n}$, maps $A_{n}$ onto $X_{n}$, and define a function $f$ from $\omega$ onto $\bigcup_{n} X_{n}$ by writing $f(k) = f_{n}(k)$ whenever $k \in A_{n}$. This result combined with the result of the preceding paragraph implies that the union of a countable set of countable sets is always countable. 

An interesting and useful corollary is that the Cartesian product of two countable sets is also countable. Since 

\begin{equation*}
X \times Y = \bigcup_{y \in Y}(X \times \{ y \}),
\end{equation*}

and since, if $X$ is countable, then, for each fixed $y$ in $Y$, the set $X \times \{ y \}$ is obviously countable (use the one-to-one correspondence $x \rightarrow (x,y)$), the result follows the preceding paragraph. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE. ] Prove that the set of all finite subsets of a countable set is countable. Prove that if every countable subset of a totally ordered set $X$ is well ordered, then $X$ itself is well ordered.

On the basis of the preceding discussion it would not be unreasonable to guess that every set is countable. We proceed to show that that is not so; this negative result is what makes the theory of cardinal numbers interesting.
