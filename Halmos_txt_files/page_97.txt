recalling that the most easily available well ordered set whose  ordinal number is $\alpha$ is the ordinal number $\alpha$ itself (and similarly for $\beta$). 

Like addition, multiplication has its good and bad properties.   Among the good ones are the identities 

\begin{allign}
\alpha 0 &= 0,
0 \alpha &= 0,
\alpha 1 &= \alpha ,
1 \alpha &= \alpha ,
\end{allign}

the associative law 

\begin{equation*}
\alpha ( \beta \gamma) = ( \alpha \beta ) \gamma , 
\end{equation*}

the left distributive law

\begin{equation*}
\alpha ( \beta  +\gamma) = ( \alpha \beta ) + \alpha \gamma , 
\end{equation*}

and the fact that if the product of two ordinal numbers is zero, then one of the factors must be zero. (Note that we use the standard convention about multiplication precedence over addition; $\alpha \beta + \alpha \gamma$ denotes $(\alpha \beta) + (\alpha \gamma)$.) 

The commutative law for multiplication fails, and so do many of its consequences. Thus, for instance, $2 \omega = \omega$ (think of an infinite sequence of ordered pairs), but $\omega 2 \neq \omega$ (think of an ordered of infinite sequences). The right distributive law also fails; that is $(\alpha + \beta) \gamma$ is in general different from $\alpha \gamma + \beta \gamma$. Example: $(1 + 1) \omega = 2 \omega = \omega$, but $l \omega + 1 \omega = \omega + \omega = \omega 2$. 

Just as repeated addition led to the definition of ordinal products, repeated multiplication could be used to define ordinal exponents. Alternatively, exponentiation can be approached via transfinite recursion. The precise details are part of an extensive and highly specialized theory of ordinal numbers. At this point we shall be content with hinting at the definition and mentioning its easiest consequences. To define $\alpha^{\beta}$ (where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers), use definition by transfinite induction (on $\beta$). Begin by writing $\alpha^{0} = 1$ and $\alpha^{\beta + 1} = \alpha^{\beta} \alpha$; if $\beta$ is a limit number, define $\alpha^{\beta}$ as the supremum of the numbers of the form $\alpha^{\gamma}$, where $\gamma < \beta$. If this sketch of a definition is formulated with care, it follows that

\begin{allign}
0^{\alpha} &= 0(\alpha \ge 1),
1^{\gamma} &= 1,
\alpha^{\beta + \gamma} &= \alpha^\beta} \alpha^{\gamma} ,
\alpha^\beta \gamma} &= (\alpha^{\beta})^{\gamma} .
\end{allign}
