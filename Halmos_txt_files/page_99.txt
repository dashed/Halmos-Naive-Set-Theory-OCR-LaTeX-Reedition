\chapter{SECTION 22: THE SCHRÃ–DER-BERNSTEIN THEOREM} 

The purpose of counting is to compare the size of one set with that of another; the most familiar method of counting the elements of a set is to arrange them in some appropriate order. The theory of ordinal numbers is an ingenious abstraction of the method, but it falls somewhat short of achieving the purpose. This is not to say that ordinal numbers are useless; it just turns out that their main use is elsewhere, in topology, for instance, as a source of illuminating examples and counterexamples. In what follows we shall continue to pay some attention to ordinal numbers, but they will cease to occupy the center of the stage. (It is of some importance to know that we could in fact dispense with them altogether. The theory of cardinal numbers can be constructed with the aid of ordinal numbers, or without it; both kinds of constructions have advantages.) With these prefatory remarks out of the way, we turn to the problem of comparing the sizes of sets. 

The problem is to compare the sizes of sets when their elements do not appear to have anything to do with each other. It is easy enough to decide that there are more people in France than in Paris. It is not quite so easy, however, to compare the age of the universe in seconds with the population of Paris in electrons. For some mathematical examples, consider the following pairs of sets, defined in terms of an auxiliary set $A$: (i) $X = A$, $Y = A^{+}$ (ii) $X = \mathcal{P}(A)$, $Y = 2^{A}$; (iii) $X$ is the set of all one-to-one mappings of $A$ into itself, $Y$ is the set of all finite subsets of $A$. In each case we may ask which of the two sets $X$ and $Y$ has more elements. The problem is first to find a rigorous interpretation of the question and then to answer it. 

The well ordering theorem tells us that every set can be well ordered. For well ordered sets we have what seems to be a reasonable measure of
