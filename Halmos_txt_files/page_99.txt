SECTION 22 THE SCHRODER-BERNSTEIN  THEOREM The purpose of counting is to compare the gize of one set with that of another; the most familiar method of counting the elements of & get is to arrange them in gome appropriate order. theory of ordinal numbers is an ingenioug abstraction of the method, but it falls somewhat short of achieving the purpose This is not to gay that ordinal numberg are use - less; it just turng out that their main use i8 elgewhere, in topology, in- stance, 8ource of illuminating examples and counterexamples In what follows we ghall continue to pay gome attention to ordinal num but they will cease to occupy the center of the gtage. (It is of some impor- tance to know that we could in fact dispense with them altogether: The theory of cardinal numbers can be constructed with the &id of ordinal numbers, or without it; both kinds of constructions have advantages ) With these prefatory remarks out of the way, we turn to the problem of comparing the gizes of gets. The problem ig to compare the sizes of gets when their elements do not appear to have anything to do with each other. It i8 easy enough to de- cide that there are more people in France than in Paris_ It i8 not quite S0 easy , bowever; to compare the age of the universe in geconds with the population of Paris in electrons. For gome mathematical examples, con- sider the following of set8, defined in terms of an euxiliary set A: 4, (ii) X P(A), Y = 24; (iii) X is the &et of all one-to one mappingg of A into itself, Y is the get of all finite gubsets of A. In each case we may ask which of the two gets X and Y has more elements The problem is firet to find rigorous interpretation of the question and then to answer it_ The well ordering theorem tells uS that every &et can be well ordered. For well ordered gets we have what geems to be & reasonable meagure of 86 Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN The for bers, pairs
