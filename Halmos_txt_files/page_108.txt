There is no difficulty about defining addition for infinitely many summands. If $\{ a_{i} \}$ is a family of cardinal numbers, and if $\{ A_{i} \}$ is a correspondingly indexed family of pairwise disjoint sets such that card $A_{i} = a_{i}$ for each $i$, then we write, by definition,

\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i} a_{i} = \text{ card } (\bigcup_{i} A_{i} ).

As before, the definition is unambiguous.

To define the product $ab$ of two cardinal numbers $a$ and $b$, we find sets $A$ and $B$ with card $A = a$ and card $B = b$, and we write $ab =$ card $(A \times B)$. The replacement of $A$ and $B$ by equivalent sets yields the same value of the product. Alternatively, we could have defined $ab$ by "adding $a$ to itself $b$ times"; this refers to the formation of the infinite sum $\sum_{i \in I} a_{i}$, where the indexed set $I$ has cardinal number $b$, and where $a_{i} = a$ for each $i$ in $I$. The reader should have no difficulty in verifying that this proposed alternative definition is indeed equivalent to the one that uses Cartesian products. Cardinal multiplication is commutative $(ab = ba)$ and associative $(a(bc) = (ab)c)$, and multiplication distributes over addition $(a(b + c) = ab + ac)$; proofs are elementary.

There is no difficulty about defining multiplication for infinitely many factors. If $\{ a_{i} \}$ is a family of cardinal numbers, if $\{ A_{i} \}$ is a correspondingly indexed family of sets such that card $A_{i} = a_{i}$ for each $i$, then we rite, by definition, 

\begin{equation*}
\prod_{i} a_{i} = \text{ card } ( \bigtimes_{i} A_{i} ).
\end{equation*}

The definition is unambiguous. 

\begin{named}[EXERCISE. ] If $\{ a_{i} \}$ ($i \in I$) and $\{ b_{i} \}$ ($i \in I$) are families of cardinal numbers such that $a_{i} < b_{i}$ for each $i$ in $I$, then $sum_{i}a_{i} < \prod_{i}b_{i}$.

We can go from products to exponents the same way as we went from sums to products. The definition of $a^{b}$, for cardinal numbers $a$ and $b$, is most profitably given directly, but an alternative approach goes via repeated multiplication. For the direct definition, find sets $A$ and $B4 with card $A = a$ and card $B = b$, and write $a^{b} =$ card $A^{B}$. Alternatively, to define $a^{b}$ "multiply $a$ by itself $b$ times." More precisely: form $\prod_{i \in I} a_{i}$, where the index set $I$ has cardinal number $b$, and where $a_{i} = a$ for each $i$
