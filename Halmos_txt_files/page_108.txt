C. 24 CARDINAL ARITHMETIC 95 ExERCISE. Prove thet if a, b, C and d cardinal number8 guch that 4b and c & d, then a + c &b + d. There is no difficulty about defining addition for infnitely many 8um- ands_ If {a;} is & family of cardinal numbers, and if {A;} i8 & corre- ondingly indexed family of pairwise disjoint sets such that card A; = a; r each i, then we write, by definition, Eia; cerd (U: 4;). before, the definition is unambiguous To define the product ab of two cardinal numbers & and b, we find gets and B with card A and card B b, and we write ab card (A X B). he replacement of A and B by equivalent sets yields the game value of the oduct. Alternatively , we could have defined ab by "adding to itself b nes" this refers to the formation of the infinite sum Ci:l C;, where the has cardinal number b, &nd where a; for each in [ The ader should have no difficulty in verifying that this proposed alternative finition is indeed equivalent to the one that u8e8 Cartesian  products ardinal multiplication is commutative (ab ba) and associative (a(bc) b)c) , and multiplication distributes over addition (a(b + c) ab + ac); proofs are elementary ExERCISE. Prove that if @, 6, C, and d are cardinal numberg guch that a &b and c & d, then ac < bd.
