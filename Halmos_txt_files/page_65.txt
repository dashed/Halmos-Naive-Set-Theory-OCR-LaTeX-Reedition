52 NANYE SET [HEOR * DEC: 13 tion that m €n i8 that Cn Indeed; the implication  from m €nto m C n is just the transitivity of If, conversely, Cn and m # n, then n m cannot happen (for then m would be & subset of one of its ele- ments) , and therefore If nl, Or if , equivalently, a proper subset of n, we shall write m <n and we shall say that m is less than n. If m is known to be either less than 7 Or else equal to n, we write Note that < and are relations in The former ig reflexive, but the latter is not; neither is symmetric; both are transitive. 4n n & m, then ExERCISE. Prove that if m <n, then m + k < n + k, and prove that if m <n and k # 0, then m.k <nk. Prove that if E is & non-empty set of natural numbers, then there exists an element k in E such that k & m for all m in E. Two sets E and F (not necessarily subsets of w) are called equivalent, in symbols E F, if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them_ It is easy to verify that equivalence in this gense, for subsets of some par- ticular set X, is an equivalence relation in the power set P(X) proper subset of & natural number n is equivalent to some smaller natural number (i.e , to some element of n). The proof of this assertion is inductive: For n 0 it is trivial If it is true for 7, and if E is & proper subset of n + , then either E is a proper subset of the induction hy- pothesis applies, Or E = nand the result is trivial, O n € E. In the latter case, find number k in n but not in E define & function f on E by writing f() when i 7 n and f(n) Clearly f is one-to-one and f maps into n. It follows that the image of E under f is either equal to n or (by the induction hypothesis) equivalent to some element of n, and, conse- quently, E itself is always equivalent to some element of n+ It is & mildly shocking fact that & set can be equivalent to & proper sub- set of itself: If, for instance, function f from to w is defined by writing f(n) =n for all n in W, then f is & one-to-one correspondence between the set of all natural numbers and the proper subset consisting of the non-zero natural numbers It is nice to know that even though the set of all natural numbers has this peculiar property, sanity prevails for each particular nat- ural number_ In other words, if n 0, then n is not equivalent to & proper subset of n For n 0 this is clear_ Suppose now that it is true for 7, and suppose that f is & one-to-one correspondence from n to & proper subset E of If n & E, then the restriction of f to n is & one-to-one correspond- ence between and & proper subset of n, which contradicts the induction hypothesis: If n & E, then n is equivalent to E {n}, 80 that, by the in- Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN and Every and and n +
