NANYE SEl  THEOR 1 SEC 42 them (together with the set-theoretic principles we have already met) it ig possible to define integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers, and to derive their usual  arithmetic and analytic  properties_ Such program is not within the scope of this book; the interested reader should have no difficulty in locating &nd studying it elsewhere Induction is often used not only to prove things but also to define things Suppose, to be specific, that f is & function from & set X into the game set X suppose that a is an element of X. It seems natural to try to define an infinite sequence {u(n) } of elements of X (that i8, function u from to X) in some such way &8 this: write u(0) 0, "(1) f(u(0)) , u(2) f(u(1)) , and on . If the would-be definer were pressed to explain the "and 80 on, he might lean on induction. What it all means, he might say, js that we define u(0) a9 @, inductively, we define u(n +) 98 f(u(n)) for every This sound plausible, but, s justification for &n existential assertion, it is insufficient_ The principle of mathematicel in- duction does indeed prove, easily, that there can be at most one function satisfying all the stated conditions, but it does not establish the existence of such & function. What is needed ig the following result_ Recursion theorem_ If a i8 an element of a set X, and if f is a function from X into X, then there exists @ function from @ inlo X such that u(0) and such that u(n +) f(u(n)) for all n in @. PROoF Recall that & function from to X is & certain kind of subset of W X X; we shall construct & explicitly as set of ordered  pairs: Con- sider , for this purpose, the collection @ of &ll those gubsets A of w X X for which (0, a) € A and for which (n f(z)) A whenever (n,2) € A_ Since X Xhas these properties, the collection @ is not empty_ We may, there- fore, form the intersection of all the gets of the collection Since it is easy to see that itself belongs to @, it remeins oly to prove that u is & function: We are to prove; in other words, that for each natural number there exists at most one element € of X guch that (n, 2) 6 U. (Explicitly : if both (n, *) and (n, y) belong to &, then y.) The proof is inductive: Let S be the set of all those natural numbers for which it is indeed true that (n, 2) for at most one €. We shall prove that 0 € S and that if n € S,then n + €S. Does 0 belong to S? If not, then (0,6) € u for some b distinct from Consider, in this case, the get & {(0, 6)} . Observe that this diminished set still containg (0, a) (since a # 6) , end that if the diminished get con- tains 2), then it containg (n f(z)) also. The reason for the second assertion i8 that since 7 0, the   discarded   element not equal to Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN and and then, may (n,
