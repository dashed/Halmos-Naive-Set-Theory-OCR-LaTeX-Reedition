them (together with the set-theoretic principles we have already met) it is possible to define integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers, and to derive their usual arithmetic and analytic  properties. Such program is not within the scope of this book; the interested reader should have no difficulty in locating and studying it elsewhere.

Induction is often used not only to prove things but also to define things. Suppose, to be specific, that $f$ is a function from a set $X$ into the same set $X$, and suppose that $a$ is an element of $X$. It seems natural to try to define an infinite sequence ${u(n)}$ of elements of $X$ (that is, a function $u$ from $\omega$ to $X$) in some such way as this: write $u(0) = a$, u(1) = f(u(0))$, $u(2) = f(u(1))$, and so on. If the would-be definer were pressed to explain the "and so on," he might lean on induction. What it all means, he might say, is that we define $u(0)$ as $a$, and then, inductively, we define $u(n^{+})$ as $f(u(n))$ for every $n$. This may sound plausible, but, as justification for an existential assertion, it is insufficient. The principle of mathematical induction does indeed prove, easily, that there can be at most one function satisfying all the stated conditions, but it does not establish the existence of such a function. What is needed is the following result.

\begin{named}[Recursion theorem. ] If $a$ is an element of a set $X$, and if $f$ is a function from $X$ into $X$, then there exists a function $u$ from $\omega$ into $X$ such that $u(0) = a$ and such that $u(n^{+}) = f(u(n))$ for all $n$ in $\omega$. 
\end{named}

Proof. Recall that a function from $\omega$ to $X$ is a certain kind of subset of $ \omega \times X$; we shall construct $u$ explicitly as a set of ordered  pairs. Consider, for this purpose, the collection $\mathcal{C}$ of all those subsets $A$ of $\omega \times X$ for which $(0, a) \in A$ and for which $(n^{+}, f(x)) \in A$ whenever $(n, x) \in A$. Since $ \omega \times X$ has these properties, the collection $\mathcal{C}$ is not empty. We may, therefore, form the intersection of all the sets of the collection $\mathcal{C}$. Since it is easy to see that $u$ itself belongs to $\mathcal{C}$, it remains only to prove that $u$ is a function. We are to prove, in other words, that for each natural number $n$ there exists at most one element $x$ of $X$ such that $(n, x) \in u$. (Explicitly : if both $(n, x)$ and $(n, y)$ belong to $u$, then $x = y$.) The proof is inductive. Let $S$ be the set of all those natural numbers $n$ for which it is indeed true that $(n, x) \in u$ for at most one $x$. We shall prove that $0 \in S$ and that if $n \in S$,then $n^{+} \in S$.

Does $0$ belong to $S$? If not, then $(0,b) \in u$ for some $b$ distinct from $a$. Consider, in this case, the set $u - \{ (0, b) \}$. Observe that this diminished set still contains $(0, a)$ (since $a \neq b$), and that if the diminished set contains $(n, x)$, then it contains $(n^{+}, f(x))$ also. The reason for the second assertion is that since $n^{+} \neq 0$, the   discarded element not equal to
