We now know that $\emptyset$ is comparable and that $g$ maps comparable sets onto comparable sets. Since the union of a chain of comparable sets is comparable, it follows that the comparable sets (in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$) constitute a tower, and hence that they exhaust $\mathcal{J}_{0}$; this is what we set out to prove about $\mathcal{J}_{0}$. 

Since $\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is a chain, the union, say $A$, of all the sets in J$\mathcal{J}_{0}$ is itself a set in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$. Since the union includes all the sets in $\mathcal{J}_{0}$, it follows that $g(A) \subset A$. Since always $A \subset g(A)$, it follows that $A = g(A)$, and the proof of Zorn'lemma is complete.

\begin{named}[Exercise. ] Zorn's lemma is equivalent to the axiom of choice. [Hint for the proof: given a set $X$, consider functions $f$ such that dom $f \subset \mathcal{P}(X)$, ran $f \subset X$, and $f(A) \in A$ for all $A$ in dom $f$; order these functions by extension, use Zorn's lemma to find a maximal one among them, and prove that if $f$ is maximal, then dom $f = \mathcal{P}(X) - \{ \emptyset \} .] Consider each of the following statements and prove that they too are equivalent to the axiom of choice. (i) Every partially ordered set has a maximal chain (i.e., a chain that is not a proper subset of any other chain). (ii) Every chain in a partially ordered set is included in some maximal chain. (iii) Every partially ordered set in which each chain has a least upper bound has a maximal element.
