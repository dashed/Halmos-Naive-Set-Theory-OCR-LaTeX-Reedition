16 LRN 5 LEMMA 05 Ve now know that / is comparable and that g maps comparable sets comparable sets. Since the union of & chain of comparable sets oparable, it follows that the comparable sets (in Jo) constitute & tower, I hence that they exhaust Jo; this is what we set out to prove about Jo: ince Jo is & chain, the union, say A, of all the gets in Jo is itself & set in Since the union includes all the sets in Jo, it follows that g(A4) € A_ always A € g(A), it follows that A 9(A), the proof of Zorn'$ lma Is complete CxERCISE Zorn's lemma is equivalent to the axiom of choice_ [Hint Or the proof: given 8 set X, consider functions f such that dom f € P(X), ran f C X, and f(A) A for all A in dom f; order these functions y extension, use Zorn's lemma to find maximal one among them, and rove that if f is maximal, then dom f P(X) {0141] Consider each f the following statements and prove that they too are equivalent to he axiom of   choice Every partially  ordered set maximal hain (i.e , & chain that is not & proper subset of any other chain). Every chain in a partially ordered set is included in some maximal chain. iii) Every partially ordered set in which each chain has least upper ound has a maximal element.
