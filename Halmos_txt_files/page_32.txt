qualifications and exceptions just because some set somewhere along some construction might turn out to be empty. There is nothing to be done about this; it is just a fact of life. 

If we restrict our attention to subsets of a particular set $E$, as we have temporarily agreed to do, then the unpleasantness described in the preceding paragraph appears to go away. The point is that in that case we define the intersection of a collection $ \mathcal{C} $ (of subsets of $E$) to be the set 

\begin{equation*}
\{ x \in E: x \in X \: for \: every \: X \in \mathcal{C} \}.
\end{equation*}

This is nothing revolutionary; for each non-empty collection, the new definition agrees with the old one. The difference is in the way the old and the new definitions treat the empty collection; according to the new definition  $\bigcap_{X \in \emptyset} X$ is equal to $E$. (For which elements $x$ of $E$ can it be false that $x \in X$ for every $X in \emptyset $?) The difference is just a matter of language. A little reflection reveals that the "new" definition offered for intersection of a collection $ \mathcal{C} $ of subsets of $E$ is really the same as the old definition of the intersection of the collection $ \mathcal{C} \cup \{ E \} $, and the latter is never empty. 

We have been considering the subsets of a set $E$; do those subsets themselves constitute a set? The following principle guarantees that the answer is yes.

\begin{named}[Axiom of powers.  ]  For each set there exists a collection of sets that contains among its elements all the subsets of the given set. 
\end{named}

In other words, if $E$ is a set, then there exists a set (collection) $ \mathcal{P} $ such that if $X \subset E$, then $X \in \mathcal{P}$.
 
The set $ \mathcal{P} $ described above may be larger than wanted; it may contain elements other than subsets of $E$. This is easy to remedy; just apply the axiom of specification to form the set $ \{ X \in \mathcal{P}: X \subset E \} $. (Recall that "$ X \subset E $"  says the same thing as "$for \: all \: x \:(if \: x \in X \: then \: x \in E) $.") Since, for every $X$, a necessary and sufficient condition that $X$ belong to this set that $X$ be subset of $E$, it follows that if we change notation and call this set $ \mathcal{P} $ again, then 

\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{P} = \{ X : X \subset E \} .
\end{equation*}

The set $ \mathcal{P} $ is called the \textit{power set} of $E$; the axiom of extension guarantees its uniqueness. The dependence of $ \mathcal{P} $ on $E$ is denoted by writing $ \mathcal{P} (E) $ instead of just $ \mathcal{P} $.

Because the set $ \mathcal{P} (E) $ is very big in comparison with $E$, it is not easy to give examples. If $E = \emptyset $, the situation is clear enough; the set $ \mathcal{P} ( \emptyset ) $ is
