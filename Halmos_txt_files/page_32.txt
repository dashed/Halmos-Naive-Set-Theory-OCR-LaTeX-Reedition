We have been considering the subsets of & set E; do those subsets them- ves constitute & set? The following principle guarantees that the answer yes_ Axiom of powers.

The set P described above may be larger than wanted; it may contain ments other than subsets of E. This is easy to remedy; just apply axiom of gpecification to form the set (X e 0: X € E}: (Recall that CE" says the game thing &8 "for all € (if € € X then E).") Since, every X, & necessary and sufficient condition that X belong to this set that X be subset of E, it follows that if we change notation and call set again, then p = {X:XcE}. e set G is called the power set of E; the axiom of extension guarantees its iqueness_ The dependence of on E is denoted by writing P(E) in- ad of just $ Because the set P(E) is very big in comparison with E, it is not easy to examples.
