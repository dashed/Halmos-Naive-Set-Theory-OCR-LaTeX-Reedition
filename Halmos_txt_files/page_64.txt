13 ARITHMETIC 51 oofs are straightforward adaptations of the oneg that worked for addi- on . The distributive law (i.e , the agsertion that k. (m + n) km + whenever k, m, and n &re natural numbers) is another easy consequence the principle of mathematical induction. (Use induction on n.) Anyone ho has worked through sums and products in this way ghould have no ouble with exponents The recursion theorem yields functiong em guch at em(0) and such that em(n +) = em(n) m for every natural number the value en (n) is, by definition, the power m" The discovery and estab- hment of the properties of powers, &8 well &9 the detailed proofs of the atements about products, can gafely be left a8 exercises for the reader_ The next topic that deserves gome attention is the theory of order in the t of natural numberg. For this purpose we proceed to examine with me care the question of which natural numbers to which others. ormally, we 8ay that two natural numbers and n are comparable if n, =n, m . Assertion: two natural numberg are mparable. The proof of this assertion consists of several steps; it will be nvenient to introduce gome notation. For each n in write S(n) for get of all in that are comparable with 7, and let S be the get of all ose n for which S(n) In these terms, the assertion ig that $ e begin the proof by ghowing that S(0) (i.e., that 0 € S). Clearly '0) containg 0. If m S(0) , then, since m & 0 is impossible, either which case 0 +), or 0 € m (in which case, again, 0 € m +) Hence, in cases, if m S(O) , then S(0) ; this proves that S(O) We com- ete the proof by showing that if S(n) 0, then S(n The fact at 0 & S(n j8 immediate (since n S(0)) ; it remains to prove that if S(n +) , then m €S( t)_ Since m € S(n +), therefore either n (in hich case n +), O n + =m (ditto) , Or m € n In the latter case, ther m (in which case m =n +), Or m The last case, in turn lits according to the behavior of m and n: since m + S(n) , we must Ive either n or n =m Or m + The first possibility is incom- tible with the present situation (i.e-, with m € n). The reason is that if then either n mOr n m, s0 that, in any case, n C and we 10w that no natural number i8 & gubset of one of its elements_ Both the maining possibilities imply that m and the proof ig complete. The preceding paragraph implies that if m and n are in 0, then at least le of the three possibilities (m n, m =n,n m) must hold; it is easy to that, in fact, always exactly one of them holds (The reason is another plication of the fact that & natural number is not a subset of one of its ements.) Another consequence of the preceding paragraph is that if n d m are distinct natural numberg, then a necessary and sufficient condi- Original ftom ed by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN belong always
