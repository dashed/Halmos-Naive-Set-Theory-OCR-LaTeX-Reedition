proofs are straightforward adaptations of the ones that worked for addition. The distributive law (i.e, the assertion that $k \dot (m + n)  = k \dot m + k \dot n$ whenever $k$, $m$, and $n$ are natural numbers) is another easy consequence of the principle of mathematical induction. (Use induction on $n$.) Anyone who has worked through sums and products in this way should have no trouble with exponents. The recursion theorem yields functions $s_{m}$ such that $e_{m}(0) = 1$ and such that $e_{m}(n^{+}) = e_{m}(n) \dot m$ for every natural number $n$; the value $e_{m}(n)$ is, by definition, the \textit{power} $m^{n}$. The discovery and establishment of the properties of powers, as well as the detailed proofs of the statements about products, can safely be left as exercises for the reader.

The next topic that deserves some attention is the theory of order in the the set of natural numbers. For this purpose we proceed to examine with some care the question of which natural numbers belong to which others. Formally, we say that two natural numbers $m$ and $n$ are comparable if $m \in n$, or $m = n$, or $n \in m$. Assertion: two natural numbers are always comparable. The proof of this assertion consists of several steps; it will be convenient to introduce some notation. For each $n$ in $\omega$, write $S(n)$ for the set of all $m$ in $\omega$ that are comparable with $n$, and let $S$ be the set of all those $n$ for which $S(n) = \omega$. In these terms, the assertion is that $S = \omega$. We begin the proof by showing that $S(0) = \omega$ (i.e., that $0 \in S$). Clearly $S(0)$ contains $0$. If $m \in S(0)$, then, since $m \in 0$ is impossible, either $m = 0$ (in which case $0 \in m^{+}), or $0 \in m$ (in which case, again, $0 \in m^{+}$). Hence, in all cases, if $m \in S(O)$, then $m^{+} \in S(0)$; this proves that $S(O) = \omega$. We complete the proof by showing that if $S(n) = \omega$, then $S(n^{+}) = \omega$. The fact that $0 \in S(n^{+})$ is immediate (since $n^{+} \in S(0)$); it remains to prove that if $m \in S(n^{+})$, then $m^{+} \in S(n^{+})$. Since $m \in S(n^{+})$, therefore either $n^{+} \in m$ (in which case n^{+} \in m^{+}), or $n^{+} = m$ (ditto), or $m \in n^{+}$. In the latter case, either $m = n$ (in which case $m^{+} = n^{+}$), or $m \in n$. The last case, in turn, splits according to the behavior of $m^{+}$ and $n$: since $m^{+} \in S(n)$, we must have either $n \in m^{+}$ or $n = m^{+}$, or $n = m^{+}$. The first possibility is incompatible with the present situation (i.e., with $m \in n$). The reason is that if $n \in m^{+}$, then either $n \in m$ or $n = m$, so that, in any case, $n \subset m$, and we know that no natural number is a subset of one of its elements. Both the remaining possibilities imply that $m^{+} \in n^{+}$, and the proof is complete. 

The preceding paragraph implies that if $m$ and $n$ are in $\omega$, then at least one of the three possibilities ($m \in n$, $m = n$, $n \in m$) must hold; it is easy to see that, in fact, always exactly one of them holds. (The reason is another application of the fact that a natural number is not a subset of one of its elements.) Another consequence of the preceding paragraph is that if $n$ and $m$ are distinct natural numbers, then a necessary and sufficient condition
