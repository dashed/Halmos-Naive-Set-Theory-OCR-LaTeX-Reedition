YDLL UnDEILNU not promised to have any relation whatsoever to any other gtructure t the given set might already possess  If, for instance, the reader knows some partially totally ordered sets whose ordering is very definitely a well ordering, he should not jump to the conclusion that he has dis- rered & paradox: The only conclusion to be drawn is that some sets can ordered in many ways, some of which are well orderings others are and we already knew that. PRoor. We apply Zorn'$ lemma  Given the set X, consider the collec- n W of all well ordered subsets of X Explicitly : an element of 1 is & set A of X together with & well ordering of A. We partially order T continuation. Che collection T is not empty, because, for instance, $ € W_ IfX # 0, annoying elements of W can be exhibited; one such is (x,2)}, for any ticular element € of X If @ is & chain in W then the union U of the 8 in has unique well ordering that makes U "larger" than (Or equal each set in @; this is exactly what our preceding discussion of continua- has accomplished. This means that the principal hypothesis 0f Zorn'$ ma has been verified; the conclusion is that there exists & maximal well lered set, say M, in W_ The must be to the entire ason : if z is an element of X not in M, then M can be enlarged by putting fter all the elements of M The rigorous formulation of this unambigu- but informal description is left &8 an exercise for the reader. With that of the way, the proof of the well ordering theorem is complete: ExERCISE Prove that & totally ordered set is well ordered if and only f the set of strict predecessors of each element is well ordered Does any uch condition apply to partially ordered sets? Prove that the well order- ng theorem implies the axiom of choice (and hence is equivalent to that xiom and to Zorn's lemma): Prove that if R is & partial order in & set K, then  there exists total order $ in X such that R € S; in other every partial  order can be extended to total  order  without nlarging the domain:.
