is not promised to have any relation whatsoever to any other structure that the given set might already possess. If, for instance, the reader knows of some partially or totally ordered sets whose ordering is very definitely not a well ordering, he should not jump to the conclusion that he has discovered a paradox. The only conclusion to be drawn is that some sets can be ordered in many ways, some of which are well orderings others are not, and we already knew that. 

Proof. We apply Zorn's lemma. Given the set $X$, consider the collection $\mathcal{W}$ of all well ordered subsets of $X$. Explicitly: an element of $\mathcal{W}$ is a subset $A$ of $X$ together with a well ordering of $A$. We partially order $\mathcal{W}$ by continuation. 

The collection $\mathcal{W}$ is not empty, because, for instance, $\emptyset \in \mathcal{W}$. If $X \neq \emptyset$, less annoying elements of $\mathcal{W}$ can be exhibited; one such is $\{ (x,x) \}$, for any particular element $x$ of $X$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is a chain in $\mathcal{W}$ then the union $U$ of the sets in $\mathcal{C}$ has a unique well ordering that makes $U$ "larger" than (or equal each to) set in $\mathcal{C}$; this is exactly what our preceding discussion of continuation has accomplished. This means that the principal hypothesis of Zorn's lemma has been verified; the conclusion is that there exists a maximal well ordered set, say $M$, in $\mathcal{W}$. The set $M$ must be equal to the entire set $X$. Reason: if $x$ is an element of $X$ not in $M$, then $M$ can be enlarged by putting $x$ after all the elements of $M$. The rigorous formulation of this unambiguous but informal description is left as an exercise for the reader. With that out of the way, the proof of the well ordering theorem is complete. 

\begin{named}[Exercise. ] Prove that a totally ordered set is well ordered if and only if the set of strict predecessors of each element is well ordered. Does any such condition apply to partially ordered sets? Prove that the well ordering theorem implies the axiom of choice (and hence is equivalent to that axiom and to Zorn's lemma). Prove that if $R$ is a partial order in a set $X$, then there exists a total order $S$ in $X$ such that $R \subset S$; in other words, every partial order can be extended to total a order without enlarging the domain.
