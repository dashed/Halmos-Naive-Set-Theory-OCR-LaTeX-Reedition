\chapter{SECTION 20: SETS OF ORDINAL NUMBERS} 

An ordinal number is, by definition, a special kind of well ordered set; we proceed to examine its special properties. 

The most elementary fact is that each element of an ordinal number $\alpha$ is at the same time a subset of $\alpha$. (In other words, every ordinal number transitive set.) Indeed, if $\xi \in \alpha$, then the fact that $s( \xi ) = \xi$ implies that each element of $\xi$ is a predecessor of $\xi$ in $\alpha$ and hence, in particular, an element of $\alpha$. 

If $\xi$ is an element of an ordinal number $\alpha$, then, as we have just geen, $\xi$ is a subset of $\alpha$, and, consequently, $\xi$ is a well ordered set (with respect to the ordering it inherits from $\alpha$). Assertion: $\xi$ is in fact an ordinal number. Indeed, if $\eta \in \xi$, then the initial segment determined by $\eta$ in $\xi$ is the same as the initial segment determined by $\eta$ in $\alpha$; since the latter is equal to $\eta$, so is the former. Another way of formulating the same result is to say that every initial segment of an ordinal number is an ordinal number. 

The next thing to note is that if two ordinal numbers are similar, then they are equal. To prove this, suppose that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers and that $f$ is a similarity from $\alpha$ onto $\beta$; we shall show that $f( \xi ) = \xi$ for each $\xi$ in $\alpha$. The proof is a straightforward transfinite induction. Write $S = \{ \xi \in \alpha : f( \xi ) = \xi \}$. For each $\xi$ in $\alpha$, the least element of $\alpha$ that does not belong to $s( \xi )$ is $\xi$ itself. Since $f$ is a similarity, it follows that the least element of $\beta$ that does not belong to the image of $s( \xi )$ under $f$ is $f( \xi )$. These assertions imply that if $s( \xi ) \subset S$, then $f(\xi )$ and $\xi$ are ordinal numbers with the same initial segments, and hence that $f(\xi ) = \xi$. We have proved thus that $\xi \in S$ whenever  $s( \xi ) \subset S$. The principle of transfinite induction implies that $S = \alpha$ and from this it follows that $\alpha = \beta$.

If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are ordinal numbers, then, in particular, they are well ordered sets, and, consequently, either they are similar or else one of them is similar
