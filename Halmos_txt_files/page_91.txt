SECTION 20 SETS OF ORDINAL NUMBERS An ordinal number is, by definition, & special kind of well ordered set; we proceed to exemine its special properties. The most elementary fect is that each element of an ordinal number i8 at the game time & gubget of &. (In other words, every ordinal number transitive get ) Indeed; if } € &, then the fact that 8(e) 1 implies that element of / i8 & predecessor of / in and hence, in particular, a0 element of &. If / ig an element of an ordinal number &, then, &8 we have just geen, & is & gubset of &, and, consequently, & is & well ordered get (with respect to the ordering it inherits from &): Assertion: / is in fact an ordinal number Indeed, if n 6 then the initial gegment determined by n in & is the same a8 the initial segment determined by 7 in &; since the latter is to %, S0 i8 the former. Another way of formulating the same result is to say that every initial gegment of en ordinal number is an ordinal number. The next thing to note is that if two ordinal numbers are similar, then they are To prove this, suppose that and 8 are ordinal numbers and that f is similarity from onto 8; we shall show that f(e) ; for each / in The proof is & gtraightforwerd transfinite induction. Write 8 = (} €&:f(e) :1. For each & in &, the least element of & that does not belong to s(e) is } itself.  Since f is & similarity, it follows that the least ele- ment of 8 that doeg not to the image of s(t) under f is f(E). These assertions imply that if s(t) C S, then f(t) and & erc ordinal numbcrs with the same initial segments, &nd hence that f(E) We have proved thus that f0S whenever  s(e) € S: The   principle  of   transfinite  induction implies that $ and from this it followg that & If & &nd 8 are ordinal numbers, then, in particular, they are well ordered sets, and, consequently, either are similar or else one of them is simi- Original Mom ed by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN each equal equal. belong _ they
