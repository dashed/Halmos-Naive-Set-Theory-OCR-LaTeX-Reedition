14 NAIVE SET THEORY SEc  student of mathematics ghould prove these things for himself at least once in his life. The proofs are based On the corresponding elemen- tary properties of the logical operator 0_ An equally gimple but quite suggestive fact is that (a} U {6} {a, b}. Whet this suggests ig the way to generalize pairs.   Specifically, wve write {a, 6, c} {a} U {b} U {c}_ The equation defineg its left gide. The right side should by rights have at least one pair of parentheses in it, but; in view of the associative law, their omission cen lead to no misunderstanding: Since it ig easy to prove that {a, 6,c} {r:z = a 0r I b 0r I = c}, we know now that for every three sets there exists & set that contains them and nothing else; it ig natural to call that uniquely determined set the (unordered) triple formed by them: The extension of the notation and terminology thus introduced to more terms (quadruples, etc ) is obvious The formation of unions hag many points of similarity with another set- theoretic operation: If A and B are sets, the intersection of A and B is the set A 0 B defined by A n B = {ceA:z eB}_ The definition i8 gymmetric in A and B even if it looks otherwise; we have A n B = {z €B:z € A}, and, in fact, Gince < € A 0 B if and oly if z belongs to both A and B, it followg that 4 0 B = {x: r € A and x € B}. The basic facts about intersections, &s well &s their proofs, are similar to the basic facts about unions: 4 0 $ = $, A 0 B = B 0 4, A 0 (B n C) = (A 0 B) 0 C, A n A = 4, A € B if and only if A 0 B = A.
