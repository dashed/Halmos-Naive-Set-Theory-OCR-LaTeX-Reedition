10 INVERSES AND COMPOSITES dly inconsistent  with our firgt interpretation of f-1 but the double aning i8 not likely to lead to any confusion.

If y &f(f-l(B)) , then y f(c) for gome € in f-!(B); this means that f(z) and f(c) € B, therefore y & B. f f maps X onto Y, then f6-'(B)) B of . If y € B, then y = f(c) for some z in X, and therefore for some {~I(B); this means that y ef(-'(B)): f A €X, then A cf-'(f(A))- Jof . If z € A, then f(z) €f(A); this means that € €f-l(f(A)): [f f is one-to-one, then A = f-'(f(A)): of . If < e f-I(f(A)), then f(z) f(A), therefore f(x) f(u) for ne u in A; this implies that z and hence that x The algebraic behavior of f -I jg unexceptionable If {B;} is & family of gets of Y, then f-'(U: B;) U:f-I(B;) f-'(O:B;) = O:f-'(B;). proofs are straightforward: If, for instance, * €f-'(O: B;), then ) B; for all 1, 80 that > €f-I(B;) for all 1, and therefore x Oif-'(B;); the steps in this argument are reversible The formation of inverse ages commutes with complementation also; i.e-, f-'(Y _ B) = X - f-'(B) each subget B of Y.
