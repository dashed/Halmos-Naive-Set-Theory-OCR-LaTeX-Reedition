\chapter{SECTION 12 THE PEANO AXIOMS}

We enter now into a minor digression. The purpose of the digression is to make fleeting contact with the arithmetic theory of natural numbers. From the set-theoretic point of view this is a pleasant luxury. 

The most important we know about the set $\omega$ of all natural numbers is that it is the unique successor set that is a subset of every successor get. To say that $\omega$ is a successor set means that

\begin{euqation}
\label{eq12.1}
0 \in \omega \tag{$(I)$}
\end{equation}

(where, of course, $0 = \emptyset$), and that 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq12.2}
\text{\textit{if} } n \in\omega, \text{ \textit{then} } n^{+} \in \omega \tag{$(II)$}
\end{equation}

(where $n^{+} = n \cup \{ n \}). The minimality property of $\omega$ can be expressed by saying that if a subset $S$ of $\omega$ is a successor set, then $S = \omega$. Alternatively, and in more primitive terms,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq12.3}
\text{\textit{if} } S \subset \omega, \text{ \textit{if} } 0 \in S, \text{ \textit{and if} } n^{+} \in S \text{ \textit{whenever} } n \in S, \text{ \textit{then} } S = \omega . \tag{$(III)%}
\end{equation}

Property \eqref{eq12.3} is known as the \textbf{principle of mathematical induction.} We shall now add to this list of properties of $\omega$ two others: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq12.4}
n^{+} \neq 0 \text{ \textit{for all} } n \text{ \textit{in} } \omega , \tag{$(IV)$}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq12.5}
\text{\textit{if} } n \text{ \textit{and} } m \text{ \textit{are in} } \omega , \text{ \textit{and if} } n^{+} = m^{+} , \text{ \textit{then} } n = m.\tag{$(V)$}
\end{equation}

The proof of \eqref{eq12.4} is trivial; since $n^{+}$ contains n, and since $0$ is empty, it is clear that $n^{+}$ is different from $0$. The proof of \eqref{eq12.5} is not trivial; it depends on couple of auxiliary propositions. The first one asserts that something that ought not to happen indeed does not bappen. Even
