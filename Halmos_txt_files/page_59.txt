SECTION 12 THE PEANO AXIOMS We enter now into & minor digression. The purpose of the digression is to make fleeting contact with the erithmetic theory of natural numbers From the set-theoretic of view this is & pleasant luxury. The most important we know about the get of all natural num bers is that it is the unique guccessor that is & gubset of every successor get. To gay that @ is & guccessor &et meang that 0 € W (where, of course, 0 = 0), and that (II) if n € W, then n + €@ (where n + =n U {n}) The minimality property of can be expressed by saying that if & subset S of @ is & guccessor set, then $ Alterna - tively, &nd in more primitive term8, (III) if S C w; if 0 €S, and if n t € 8 whenever n € S, then $ Property (III) is known &8 the principle of mathematical induction: We ghall now add to this list of properties of others (IV) n + 40 jor all n in W, if n and m are in W, and if n+ = mt,then n = m The proof of (IV) is trivial; since n + containg 7, and gince 0 i8 empty, it is clear that n + ig different from 0. The proof of is not triv- ial; it depends on couple of guxiliary propositions_ The first one asserts that something that ought not to happen indeed does not bappen.
