418 "ANSFINME RECURSION A second consequence is the fact that & well ordered get is never similar one of its initial segments: If, indeed, X is & well ordered set, a is an ement of X, and f is & similarity from X onto s(a) , then, in particular, s(a) , s0 that f(a) < 4, and that is impossible. The third and chief consequence is the comparability theorem for well dered sets. The assertion is that if X and Y are well ordered sets, then ther X and are similar, Or one of them is gimiler to an initial segment of e other. Just for practice we shall use the transfinite recursion theorem the proof, although it is perfectly easy to avoid it. We assume that X d are non-empty well ordered gets such that neither is similar to an itial segment of the other; we proceed to prove that under these circum- ances X must be similar to Y. Suppose that a â‚¬ X and that is a sequence type a in Y; in other words t is & function from s(a) into Y. Let f() be e least of the proper upper bounds of the range of t in Y, if there are any; the contrary case, let f(C) be the least element of Y In the terminology the transfinite recursion theorem; the function f thereby determined is sequence function of type X in Y. Let U be the function that the trans- ite recursion theorem associates with this situation An easy argument y transfinite induction) shows that, for each 2 in X, the function U maps e initial segment determined by a in X one-to-one onto the initial seg- ent determined by U(a) in Y. This implies that U is & similarity, and proof is complete. Here is & sketch of an alternative that does not use the transfinite cursion theorem  Let Xo be the set of those elements of X for which ere exists an element b of Y such that s(a) is similar to 8() For each in Xo, write U(a) for the corresponding (uniquely determined) b in Y, d let Yo be the range of U_ It follows that either Xo X, O else Xo is initial segment of X and Yo = Y ExERCISE: Each subset of a well ordered set X is similar either to X or to an initial segment of X_ If X and Y are well ordered sets Xey (i.e , X is similar to Y), then the similarity maps the least upper bound (if any) of each subset of X onto the least upper bound of the image of that subset Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN proof and
