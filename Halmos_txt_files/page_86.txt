A second consequence is the fact that a well ordered set is never similar to one of its initial segments. If, indeed, $X$ is a well ordered set, $a$ is an element of $X$, and $f$ is a similarity from $X$ onto $s(a)$, then, in particular, $f(a) \in s(a)$, so that $f(a) < a$, and that is impossible. 

The third and chief consequence is the comparability theorem for well ordered sets. The assertion is that if $X$ and $Y$ are well ordered sets, then either $X$ and $Y$ are similar, or one of them is similer to an initial segment of the other. Just for practice we shall use the transfinite recursion theorem in the proof, although it is perfectly easy to avoid it. We assume that $X$ and $Y$ are non-empty well ordered sets such that neither is similar to an initial segment of the other; we proceed to prove that under these circumstances $X$ must be similar to $Y$. Suppose that $a \in X$ and that $t$ is a sequence of type $a$ in $Y$; in other words $t$ is a function from $s(a)$ into $Y$. Let $f(t)$ be the least of the proper upper bounds of the range of $t$ in $Y$, if there are any; in the contrary case, let $f(t)$ be the least element of $Y$. In the terminology of the transfinite recursion theorem, the function $f$ thereby determined is a sequence function of type $X$ in $Y$. Let $U$ be the function that the transfinite recursion theorem associates with this situation. An easy argument (by transfinite induction) shows that, for each $z$ in $X$, the function $U$ maps the initial segment determined by $a$ in $X$ one-to-one onto the initial segment determined by $U(a)$ in $Y$. This implies that $U$ is a similarity, and the proof is complete. 

Here is a sketch of an alternative proof that does not use the transfinite cursion theorem. Let $X_{0}$ be the set of those elements $a$ of $X$ for which there exists an element $b$ of $Y$ such that $s(a)$ is similar to $s(b)$. For each $a$ in $X_{0}$, write $U(a)$ for the corresponding (uniquely determined) $b$ in $Y$, and let $Y_{0}$ be the range of $U$. It follows that either $X_{0} = X$, ot else $X_{0}$ is an initial segment of $X$ and $Y_{0} = Y$. 

\begin{named}[Exercise. ] Each subset of a well ordered set $X$ is similar either to $X$ or to an initial segment of $X$. If $X$ and $Y$ are well ordered sets and $X \tilde{=} Y$ (i.e., $X$ is similar to $Y$), then the similarity maps the least upper bound (if any) of each subset of $X$ onto the least upper bound of the image of that subset.
