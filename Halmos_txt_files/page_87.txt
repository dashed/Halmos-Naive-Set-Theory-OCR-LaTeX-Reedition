\chapter{SECTION 19: ORDINAL NUMBERS} 

The successor $x^{+}$ of a set $x$ was defined as $x \cup \{ x \} $, and then $\omega$ was constructed as the smallest set that contains $0$ and that contains $x^{+}$ whenever it contains $x$. What happens if we start with $\omega$, form its successor $\omega^{+}$, then form the successor of that, and proceed so on ad infinitum? In other words: is there something out beyond $\omega$, $\omega^{+}$, (\omega^{+})^{+}, \cdots, etc., in the same sense in which $\omega$ is beyond $0$, $1$, $2$, $\cdots$, etc.? 

The question calls for a set, say $T$, containing $\omega$, such that each element of $T$ (other than $\omega$ itself) can be obtained from $\omega$ by the repeated formation of successors. To formulate this requirement more precisely we introduce some special and temporary terminology. Let us say that a function $f$ whose domain is the set of strict predecessors of some natural number $n$  (in other words, dom $f = n$) is an \textit{$\omega$-successor function} if $f(0) = \omega$ (provided that $n \neq 0$, so that $0 < n$), and $f(m^{+}) = (f(m))^{+}$ whenever $m^{+} < n$. An easy proof by mathematical induction shows that for each natural number there exists a unique $\omega$-successor function with domain $n$. To say that something is either equal to $\omega$ or can be obtained from $\omega$ by the repeated formation of successors means that it belongs to the range of some $\omega$-successor function. Let $S(n,x)$ be the sentence that says "$n$ is a natural number and belongs to the range of the $\omega$-successor function with domain $n$." A set $T$ such that $x \in T$ if and only if $S(n,x)$ is true for some $n$ is what we are looking for; such a set is as far beyond $\omega$ as $\omega$ is beyond $0$. 

We know that for each natural number $n$ we are permitted to form the set $\{ x: S(n,x) \}$. In other words, for each natural number $n$, there exists a set $F(n)$ such that $x \in F(n)$ if and only if $S(n,x)$ is true. The connection between $n$ and $F(n)$ looks much like a function. It turns out, however
