SECTION 19 ORDINAL NUMBERS The successor z + of & get x was defined as z U {z}, and then w was con- structed &8 the smallest set that contains 0 and that contains x whenever it contains What happens if we btart with 0, form its successor then form the successor of that, and proceed 80 on ad infinitum? In other words: i8 there something out beyond @, @ (o+)- in the same gense in which w is beyond 0, 1, 2, etc ? The question calls for & set, say T, containing @, such that each element of T (other than W itself) can be obtained from @ by the repeated formation of guccegsors_ To formulate this requirement more precisely we introduce bome special and temporary terminology. Let us say that function f whose domain is the set of strict predecessors of gome natural number (in other words, dom f n) i8 &n W-successor function if f(0) (provided that n # 0, 80 that 0 < n), and f(m (f(m)) whenever m An easy proof by mathematical induction ghowg that for each natural number there exists & unique w-successor function with domain To say that something is either equal to W Or can be obtained from by the repeated formation of successors means that it belongs to the range of some W-suC- cessor function. Let S(n, 2) be the sentence that says natural number and belongs to the range of the W-successor function with do- main n. A get T guch that € € T if and only if S(n, =) is true for some n is what we are looking such & set is far beyond a8 W i8 beyond 0. We know that for each natural number n we are permitted to form the set {x: S(n, z)}. In other words, for each natural number n, there exists set such that € F(n) if and only if S(n, z) is true: The connection between and F(n) looks much like & function.
