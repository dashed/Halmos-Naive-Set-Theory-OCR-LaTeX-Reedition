$\mathcal{C}$. If $\beta$ is another upper bound of $\mathcal{C}$, then $\xi \subset \beta$ whenever $\xi \in \mathcal{C}$, and therefore, by the definition of unions, $\alpha \subset \beta$. This implies that $\alpha$ is the least upper bound of $\mathcal{C}$; we have proved thus that every set of ordinal numbers has a supremum. 

Is there a set that consists exactly of all the ordinal numbers? It is easy to see that the answer must be no. If there were such a set, then we could form the supremum of all ordinal numbers. That supremum would be an ordinal number greater than to every ordinal number. Since, however, for each  ordinal number there exists strictly greater one (for example, its successor), this is impossible; it makes no sense to speak of the "set" of all ordinals. The contradiction, based on the assumption that there is such a set, is called the \textit{Burali-Forti paradox}. (Burali-Forti was one man, not two.) 

Our next purpose is to show that the concept of an ordinal number is not so special as it might appear, and that, in fact, each well ordered set resembles some ordinal number in all essential respects. "Resemblance" here is meant in the technical sense of similarity. An informal statement of the result is that each well ordered set can be counted.

PROOF. Since for ordinal numbers similarity is the same as equality, uniqueness is obvious. Suppose now that $X$ is a well ordered and suppose that an element $a$ of $X$ is such that the initial segment determined by each predecessor of $a$ is similar to some (necessarily unique) ordinal number. If $S(x, \alpha)$ is the sentence that says "$\alpha$ is an ordinal number and $s(x) \cong \alpha$," then, for each $x$ in $s(a)$, the set $\{ \alpha : S(x, \alpha ) \}$ can be formed; in fact, that set is a singleton. The axiom of substitution implies the existence of a set consisting exactly of the ordinal numbers similar to the initial segments determined by the predecessors of $a$. It follows, whether $a$ is the immediate successor of one of its predecessors or the supremum of them all, that $s(a)$ is similar to an ordinal number. This argument prepares the way for an application of the principle of transfinite induction; the conclusion is that each initial segment in $X$ is similar to some ordinal number. This fact, in turn, justifies another application of the axiom of substitution, just like the one made above; the final conclusion is, as desired, that $X$ is similar to some ordinal number.
