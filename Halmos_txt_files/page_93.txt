If 8 is another upper bound of @, then / C 8 whenever } € @, and there- fore, by the definition of unions, CB. This implies that a is the least upper bound of @; we have proved thug that every set of ordinal numbers has & gupremum Is there & 8et that congists exactly of &ll the ordinal numbers? It is easy to gee that the answer mugt be no. If there were such a set, then we could form the supremum of all ordinal numbers: That gupremum would be an ordinal number greater than to every ordinal number_ Since, however, for each  ordinal number there exists strictly greater one (for example, its successor) , this is impossible; it makes no sense to speak of the "set" of all ordinals_ The contradiction; based on the assumption that there i8 such set _ ig called the Burali-Forti paradoz_ (Burali-Forti was one man, not two:_ Our next purpose is to ghow that the concept of an ordinal number is not 80 special a8 it might appear, and that, in fact, each well ordered set resembles some ordinal number in all essential respects "Resemblance" here is meant in the technical senge of similarity. An informal statement of the result is that each well ordered get can be counted. Counting theorem_ Each well ordered set is similar to a unique ordinal number PRooF. Since for ordinal numbers similarity is the game &s equality , uniqueness is obvious_ Suppose now that X is & well ordered and sup- pose that an element & of X is such that the initial segment determined by each predecessor of a i8 gimilar to gome (necessarily unique) ordinal num- ber_ If S(z , &) is the sentence that says "a is an ordinal number and s(z) 2& then, for each € in s(a), the set {a: S(z, 0)} can be formed; in fact that set is singleton. The axiom of substitution implies the existence of Bet congisting exactly of the ordinal numberg similar to the initial seg- ments determined by the predecessors of It follows, whether is the immediate successor of one of its predecessors or the supremum of them all, that s(a) is similar to an ordinal number: This argument prepares the way for an application of the principle of transfinite induction; the conclu- sion ig that each initial segment in X is similar to gome ordinal number_ This fact, in turn, justifies another application of the axiom of substitu- just like the one made above; the final conclusion is, &s desired, that X is similar to some ordinal number: Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN equal set tion,
