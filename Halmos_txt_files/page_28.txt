EC: UNIONS AND INTERSECTIONS 15 'airs of sets with an empty intersection occur frequently enough to justify use of special word: if A 0 B = $, the sets A and B are called isjoint. The same word is sometimes applied to & collection of sets dicate that any two distinct sets of the collection are disjoint; alterna- vely we may speak in such & situation of & pairwise disjoint collection. Two useful facts about unions and intersections involve both the opera- iong at the same time: A 0 (B U C) = (A 0 B) U (A n C), A U (B nc (A U B) n (A U C). "hese identitieg are called the distributive laws By way of & sample of t-theoretic proof, we the second one_ If x belongs to the left side, nen x belongs either to A o to both B and C; if € is in A, then € is in both U B and A U C, and if z is in both B and C, then, again, € is in both U B and A U C;it follows that, in any case, I belongs to the right side 'his proves that the right side includes the left_ To prove the reverse in- lusion, just observe that if z belongs to both A U B and A U C, then € elongs either to Or to both B and C The formation of the intergection of two sets A and B, OT, we might as ell say, the formation of the intersection of & (A, B} of sets, is pecial case of & much more general operation: (This is another respect in hich the theory of intersections imitates that of unions.) The existence the general operation of intersection depends on the fact that for each on-empty collection of sets there exists & set that contains exactly those lements that belong to every set of the given collection. In other words: each collection @, other than /, there exists & set such that € € V if nd only if x X for every X in To prove this assertion; let A be any articular set in @ (this is justified by the fact that @ # 0) and rite V = (z € A:€ e X for every X in @} The condition means "for all X (if X € @, then € € X) .") The dependence fV on the arbitrary choice of A is illusory; in fact V {r: I eX for every X in @}. he get V is called the intersection of the collection @ of sets; the axiom extension guarantees its uniqueness. The customary notation is similar the one for unions: instead of the unobjectionable but unpopular Origlnal ftom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN prove pair step
