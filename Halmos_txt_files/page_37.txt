24 NAIYE SET MHEOH Y Sec: and {a,6} are elements of P(A U B)_ This implies that ( {a}, {a,b} } is & subset of (A U B), and hence that it is &n element of P(P(A U B)); in other words (a, 6) € P(P(A U B)) whenever & € A and B Once this is known, it is & routine matter to apply the axiom of specification and the axiom of extension to produce the unique set A X B that consists exactly of the ordered pairs (a, 6) with a in A and b in B. This set ig called the Cartesian product of A and B; it is characterized by the fact that AXB = {c: I (a,6) for sme a in A and for some b in B} The Cartesian product of two gets is & get of ordered pairs (that i8, & set each of whose elements is an ordered pair), and the game is true of every subset of & Cartesian product It is of technical importance to know that we can g0 in the converse direction also: every set of ordered is & subset of the Cartesian product of two sets_ In other words: if R is & set guch that every element of R is an ordered pair, then there exist two gets A and B such that R € A X B_ The proof is elementary.   Suppose indeed that €R, s0 that € = {a}, {a,6} } for some a and for gome b. The problem is to dig out and b from under the braces. Since the elements of R are sets, we can form the union of the sets in R; since € is one of the sets in R, the elements of z belong to that union_ Since {a,b} is one of the elements of 1, we may in what been   called the brutal notation above, {a,6} UR: One set of braces has disappeared; let u8 do the same again to make the other set go away. Form the union of the gets in U R_ Since {G, b} is one of those sets, it follows that the elements of {a,b} to that union, and hence both and b belong to U U R This fulfills the promise made above; to exhibit R as & subset of some A X B, we may take both A and B to be U U R. It ig often desirable to take A and B &8 gmall a5 possible: To do just apply the axiom of specification to produce the sets {a: for some b ((a,b) € R)} and {b: for some a ((a,b) € R)}_ These sets are called the projections of R oto the first and gecond coordi- nates respectively However important set theory may be now, when it some scholars considered it 9 disease from which, it was to be hoped, mathematics would soon recover _ For   this reason many set-theoretic   considerations were called pathological, and the word lives on in mathematical usage; it often refers to Bomething the gpeaker does not like: The explicit definition of an Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN b & pairs bas write, thing belong 80, began
