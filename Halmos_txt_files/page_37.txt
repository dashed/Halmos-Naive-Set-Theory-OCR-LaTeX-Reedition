and $ \{ a, b \} $ are elements of $ \mathcal{P} (A \cup B)$. This implies that $ \{ \{ a \}, \{ a,b \} \} $ is a subset of $ \mathcal{P} (A \cup B) $, and hence that it is an element of $ \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} (A \cup B))$; in other words $(a, b) \in \mathcal{P} ( \mathcal{P} (A \cup B))$ whenever $ a \in  A$ and $ b \in B$. Once this is known, it is a routine matter to apply the axiom of specification and the axiom of extension to produce the unique set $A \times B$ that consists exactly of the ordered pairs $(a, b)$ with $a$ in $A$ and $b$ in $B$. This set is called the \textit{Cartesian product} of $A$ and $B$; it is characterized by the fact that 

\begin{equation*}
A \times B = \{ x: x = (a,b) \: for \: some \: a \: in A \: \: and \: for \: some \: b \: in \: B \}.
\end{equation*}

The Cartesian product of two sets is a set of ordered pairs (that is, a set each of whose elements is an ordered pair), and the same is true of every subset of a Cartesian product. It is of technical importance to know that we can go in the converse direction also: every set of ordered pairs is a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets. In other words: if $R$ is a set such that every element of $R$ is an ordered pair, then there exist two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $R \subset A \times B $. The proof is elementary. Suppose indeed that $ x \in R$, so that $ x = \{ \{ a \}, \{ a, b \} \}$ for some $a$ and for some $b$. The problem is to dig out $a$ and $b$ from under the braces. Since the elements of $R$ are sets, we can form the union of the sets in $R$; since $x$ is one of the sets in $R$, the elements of $x$ belong to that union. Since $\{ a,b \}$ is one of the elements of $x$, we may in what has been called the brutal notation above, $ \{a,b \} \in \bigcup R$. One set of braces has disappeared; let us do the same thing again to make the other set go away. Form the union of the sets in $ \bigcup R$. Since $ \{ a, b \}$ is one of those sets, it follows that the elements of $ \{ a,b \}$ belong to that union, and hence both $a$ and $b$ belong to $ \bigcup \bigcup R$. This fulfills the promise made above; to exhibit $R$ as a subset of some $A \times B$, we may take both $A$ and $B$ to be $ \bigcup \bigcup R$. It is often desirable to take $A$ and $B$ as small as possible. To do so, just apply the axiom of specification to produce the sets

\begin{equation*}
A = \{ a : \: for \: some \: b ((a,b) \in R) \}
\end{equation*}

and 

\begin{equation*}
B = \{ b : \: for \: some \: a ((a,b) \in R) \}
\end{equation*}

These sets are called the \textit{projections} of $R$ onto the first and second coordinates respectively.

However important set theory may be now, when it began some scholars considered it a disease from which, it was to be hoped, mathematics would soon recover. For this reason many set-theoretic considerations were called pathological, and the word lives on in mathematical usage; it often refers to something the speaker does not like. The explicit definition of an
