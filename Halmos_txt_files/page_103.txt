SECTION 23 COUNTABLE SETS If X and Y are sets guch that Y dominates X and X dominates Y, then the Schroder-Bernstein theorem applies and says that X is equivalent to Y. If Y dominates X but X does not dominate Y, 80 that X is not equiva- lent to Y, we ghall write X < Y, we shall gay that Y strictly dominates X  Domination and strict domination can be used to express some of the facts about finite and infinite sets in neat form. Recall that set X is called finite in cage it i8 equivalent to gome natural number; otherwise it is infinite. We know that if X < Y and Y is finite, then X is finite, and we know that i8 infinite ($ 13); we know also that if X is infinite, then <X (8 15). The converse of the last assertion is true and can be proved either directly (using the fact that finite set cannot be equivalent to proper subset of itself) Or 18 &n application of the Schroder-Bernstein the- orem_ (If <X, then it i8 impossible that there exist & natural number such that X ~n, for then we should have w X n, and that contradicts the fact that w is infinite. We have just seen that & set X is infinite if and only if w < X; next we shall prove that X is finite if only if X The proof depends on the transitivity of strict domination: if X < Y and Y < Z, if at least one of these dominationg i8 strict, then X <%. Indeed, clearly, X < Z. If we had Z < X, then we should have Y < X and Z < Y and hence (by the Schroder-Bernstein theorem) X Y and Y ~ Z, in contradiction the assumption of strict domination. If now X is finite, then X ~n for 8ome natural number n, and, since W 18 infinite, n < W, 80 that X 90 Original Mom 20 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN and and and
