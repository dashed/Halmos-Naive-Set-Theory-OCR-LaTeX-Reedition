\chapter{SECTION 23: COUNTABLE SETS} 

If $X$ and $Y$ are sets such that $Y$ dominates $X$ and $X$ dominates $Y$, then the Schröder-Bernstein theorem applies and says that $X$ is equivalent to $Y$. If $Y$ dominates $X$ but $X$ does not dominate $Y$, so that $X$ is not equivalent to $Y$, we shall write 

\begin{equation*}
X \prec Y, 
\end{equation*}

we shall say that $Y$ \textit{strictly dominates} $X$.

Domination and strict domination can be used to express some of the facts about finite and infinite sets in neat form. Recall that a set $X$ is called finite in case it is equivalent to some natural number; otherwise it is infinite. We know that if $X \precsim Y$ and $Y$ is finite, then $X$ is finite, and we know that $\omega$ is infinite (See \cref{chapter:Chapter_13}); we know also that if $X$ is infinite, then $\omega \precsim X$ (\cref{chapter:Chapter_15}). The converse of the last assertion is true and can be proved either directly (using the fact that a finite set cannot be equivalent to proper a subset of itself) or as an application of the Schröder-Bernstein theorem. (If $\omega \precsim X$, then it is impossible that there exists a natural number $n$ such that $X \sim n$, for then we should have $\omega \precsim n$, and that contradicts the fact that $\omega$ is infinite.) 

We have just seen that a set $X$ is infinite if and only if $\omega \precsim X$; next we shall prove that $X$ is finite if only if $X \prec \omega$. The proof depends on the transitivity of strict domination: if $X \precsim Y$ and $Y \precsim Z$, and if at least one of these dominations is strict, then $X \prec Z$. Indeed, clearly, $X \precsim Z$. If we had $Z \precsim X$, then we should have $Y \precsim X$ and $Z \precsim Y$ and hence (by the Schröder-Bernstein theorem) $X \sim Y$ and $Y \sim Z$, in contradiction to the assumption of strict domination. If now $X$ is finite, then $X \sim n$ for some natural number $n$, and, since $\omega$ is infinite, $n \prec \omega$, so that $X \prec \omega$.
