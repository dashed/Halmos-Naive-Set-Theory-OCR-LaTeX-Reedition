for the order; say $S$. If $(a,b)$ and $(x,y)$ are ordered pairs of natural numbers, then $(a,b)S(x,y)$ means, by definition, that either $a$ is strictly less than $x$ (in the customary sense), or else $a = x$ and $b \le y$. Because of its resemblance to the way words are arranged in dictionary, this is called the \textit{lexicographical} order of $\omega \times \omega$. (iii) Once more the set is $\omega \times \omega$. The present order relation, say $T$, is such that $(a,b)T(x,y)$ means, by definition, that $a \le x$ and $b \le y$.
