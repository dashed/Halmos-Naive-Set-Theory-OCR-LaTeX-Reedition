\chapter{SECTION 8: FUNCTIONS}

If $X$ and $Y$ are sets, a \textit{function} from (or \textit{on}) $X$ \textit{to} (or \textit{into}) $Y$ is a relation $f$ such that dom $f = X$ and such that for each $x$ in $X$ there is a unique element $y$ in $Y$ with $(x, y) \in f$. The uniqueness condition can be formulated explicitly as follows: if $(x, y) \in f$ and $(x, z) \in f$, then $y = z$. For each $x$ in $X$, the unique $y$ in $Y$ such that $(x, y) \in f$ is denoted by $f(x)$. For functions this notation and its minor variants supersede the others used for more general relations; from now on, if $f$ is a function, we shall write $f(x) = y$ instead of $(x, y) \in f$ or $x f y$. The element $y$ is called the \textit{value} that the function $f$ \textit{assumes} (or \textit{takes on}) at the \textit{argument} $x$; equivalently we may say that $f$ \textit{sends} or \textit{maps} or \textit{transforms} $x$ onto $y$. The words \textit{map} or \textit{mapping, transformation, correspondence,} and \textit{operator} are among some of the many that are sometimes used as synonyms for \textit{function}. The symbol

\begin{equation*}
f: X \rightarrow Y
\end{equation*}

is sometimes used as an abbreviation for "$f$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$." The set of all functions $X$ to $Y$ is a subset of the power set $\mathcal{P}(X \times Y)$; it will be denoted by $Y^{X}$. 

The connotations of activity suggested by the synonyms listed above make some scholars dissatisfied with the definition according to which function does not \textit{do} anything but merely \textit{is}. This dissatisfaction is reflected in a different use of the vocabulary: \textit{function} is reserved for the undefined object that is somehow active, and the set of ordered pairs that we have called the function is then called the \textit{graph} of the function. It is easy to find examples of functions in the precise set-theoretic sense of the word in both mathematics and everyday life; all we have to look for is information, not necessarily numerical, in tabulated form. One example
