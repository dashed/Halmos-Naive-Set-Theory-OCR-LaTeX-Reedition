SECTION FUNCTIONS If X and Y are gets, 8 function from (or o) X to (Or into) Y is & relation f guch that dom f = X and such that for each € in X there is & unique ele- ment y in Y with (1, y) ef. The uniqueness condition can be formulated explicitly &s follows: if (v, y) ef and (x, 2) €f, then y = 2 For each x in X,the unique y in Y guch that (z, y) ef is denoted by f(z). For functions this notation and its minor variants supersede the others used for more general relations; from now on , if f is & function, we ghall write f(z) instead of (1, y) ef o xf y. The element y is called the value that the function f assumes (Or takes on) at the argument >; equivalently we may say that sends Or maps Or transforms € onto y: The words map or map- ping, transformation, CoTT espondence, and operator are among some of the many that are gometimes used as synonyms for function. The symbol f:X 3 Y is gometimes used &s an abbreviation for "f i8 & function from X to Y" The get of all functiong Xto Y is & subget of the power set P(X X Y); it will be denoted by YX The connotations of activity suggested by the synonymg listed above make gome gcholars dissatisfied with the definition according to which function does not do anything but merely is. This disgatisfaction is re- fected in & different use of the vocabulary: function is reserved for the un- defined object that ig somehow active, and the get of ordered pairs that we have called the function is then called the graph of the function. It is easy to find examples of functions in the precise set-theoretic gense of the word in both mathematics everyday life; &ll we bave to look for is information, not necessarily numerical, in tabulated form.
