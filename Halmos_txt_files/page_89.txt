At this point we make contact with our earlier discussion of what happens beyond $\omega$. The axiom of substitution implies easily that there exists a unique function $F$ on $\omega$ such that $F(0) = \omega$ and $F(n^{+}) = (F(n))^{+}$ for each natural number $n$. The range of this function is a set of interest for us; a set of even greater importance is the union of the set $\omega$ with the range of the function $F$. For reasons that will become clear only after we have at least glanced at the arithmetic of ordinal numbers, that union is usually denoted by \omega 2. If, borrowing again from the notation of ordinal arithmetic, we write $\omega + n$ for $F(n)$, then we can describe the set $\omega 2$ as the set consisting of all $n$ (with $n$ in $\omega$) and of all $\omega + n$ (with $n$ in $\omega$). 

It is now easy to verify that $\omega 2$ is an ordinal number. The verification depends, of course, on the definition of order in $\omega 2$. At this point both that definition and the proof are left as exercises; our official attention turns to some general remarks that include the facts about $\omega 2$ as easy special cases. 

An order (partial or total) in a set $X$ is uniquely determined by its initial segments. If, in other words, $R$ and $S$ are orders in $X$, and if, for each $x$ in $X$, the set of all $R$-predecessors of $x$ is the same as the set of all $S$-predecessors of $x$, then $R$ and $S$ are the same. This assertion is   obvious whether predecessors are taken in the strict sense or not. The assertion applies, in particular, to well ordered sets. From this special case we infer that if it is possible at all to well order a set so as to make it an ordinal number, then there is only one way to do so. The set alone tells us what the relation that makes it an ordinal number must be; if that relation satisfies the requirements, then the set is an ordinal number, and otherwise it is not. To say that $s( \xi ) = \xi $ means that the predecessors of $\xi$ must be just the elements of $\xi$. The relation in question is therefore simply the relation of belonging. If $\eta <  \xi$ is defined to mean $\eta \in \xi$ whenever $\xi$ and $\eta$ are elements of a set $\alpha$, then the result either is or is not a well ordering of $\alpha$ such that $s( \xi ) = \xi$ for each $\xi$ in $\alpha$, and is an ordinal number in the one case and not in the other. ]

We conclude this preliminary discussion of ordinal numbers by mentioning the names of the first few of them. After $0$, $1$, $2$, $\cdots$ comes $\omega$, and after $\omega$, $\omega + 1$, $\omega + 2$, $\cdots$ comes $\omega 2$. After $\omega 2 + 1$ (that is, the successor of $\omega 2$) comes $\omega 2 + 2$, and then $\omega 2 + 3$; next after all the terms of the sequence begun comes $\omega 3$. (Another application of the axiom of substitution is needed at this point.) Next come $\omega 3 + 1$, $\omega 3 + 2$, $\omega 3 + 3$, $cdots$, and after them comes $\omega 4$. In this way we get successively $\omega$, $\omega 2$, $\omega 3$, $\omega 4$, $cdots$. An application of the axiom of substitution yields something that follows them all in the same sense in which $\omega$ follows the naturql numbers; that something
