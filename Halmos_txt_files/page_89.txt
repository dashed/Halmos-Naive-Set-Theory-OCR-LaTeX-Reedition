NAIVE SEI  IHEOR Y SEC _ 19 At this we make contact with our earlier discussion of what happens beyond The axiom of gubstitution implies easily that there exists unique function F on guch that F(0) w and F(n` (F(n)) + for each natural number n. The range of this function is & get of interest for US; & Bet of even greater importance is the union of the set with the range of the function F. For reasons that will become clear only after we have at least glenced &t the arithmetic of ordinal numbers, that union is usually denoted by 62. If, borrowing again from the notation of ordinal arith - metic, we write W + n for F(n) , then we can describe the set 62 &8 the set congisting of all n (with n in @) and of all w + n (with n in w)_ It is nOw easy to verify that 62 is an ordinal number_ The verificativn depends, of course on the definition of order in 02. At this point both that definition &nd the proof are left 28 exercises; our official attention turng to gome general remarks that include the facts about w2 easy special cases An order (partial or total) in & set X is uniquely determined by its initial segments_ If, in other words, R and S are orders in X, and if, for each in X, the get of all R-predecessorg of € is the same &8 the get of all S-pred- ecessors   of 1, then R and are the same_ Thig assertion is   obvious wbether predecessorg &re taken in the strict sense or not_ The assertion applies, in particular; to well ordered sets. this case we infer that if it is possible &t all to well order & set g0 a8 to make it an ordinal number, then there j8 only one way to do s0. The get &lone tells us what the relation that makeg it an ordinal number must be; if that relation sat- isfies the requirements, then the set is an ordinal number, and otherwise it j8 not_ To 8ay that s(e) = € meang that the predecessorg of / must be just the elements of & The relation in question ig therefore simply the relation of belonging: If n < } is defined to mean n € / whenever / and 7 are elements of & get &, then the result either ig 0r is not well ordering of such that s(e) for each / in 0, and is &n ordinal number in the one case and not in the other. We conclude this preliminary discussion of ordinal numberg by mention- ing the names of the firgt few of them. After 0, 1,2 , comes W, and after 0, W + 1,w + 2, comes 62 After 62 + 1 (that i8, the successor of 02) comes 62 + 2, and then 02 + 3; next after &ll the terms of the sequence begun comes 63. (Another application of the axiom of gubstitution is needed at this point ) Next come 63 + 1, 63 + 2, 63 + 3, and after them comeg 04_ In this way we get successively @, 62, 63, 64, An ap plication of the axiom of gubstitution yields something that followg them ell in the game &ense in which follows the naturel numbers; that gome- Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN point From speciel
