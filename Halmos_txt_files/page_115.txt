set each of whase initial segments is finite; correspondingly, the most important property of $\Omega$ is that it is an uncountably infinite well ordered set each of whose initial segments is countable. 

The least uncountable ordinal number $\Omega$ clearly  satisfies the defining condition of a cardinal number; in its cardinal role it is always denoted by $\aleph_{1}$. Equivelently, $\aleph_{1}$ may be characterized as the least cardinal number strictly greater than $\aleph_{0}$, or, in other words, the immediate successor of $\aleph_{0}$ in the ordering of cardinal numbers. 

The arithmetic relation between $\aleph_{0}$ and $\aleph_{1}$ is the subject of a famous old problem about cardinal numbers. How do we get from $\aleph_{0}$ to $\aleph_{1}$ by arithmetic operations? We know by now that the most elementary steps, involving sums and products, just lead from $\aleph_{0}$ back to $\aleph_{0}$ again. The simplest we know to do that starts with $\aleph_{0}$ and ends up with something larger is to form $2^{\aleph_{0}}$. We know therefore that $\aleph_{1} \le 2^{\aleph_{0}}$. Is the inequality strict? Is there an uncountable cardinal number strictly less than $2^{\aleph_{0}}$? The celebrated \textit{continuum hypothesis} asserts, as a guess, that the answer is no, or, in other words, that $\aleph_{1} \le 2^{\aleph_{0}}$. All that is known for sure is that the continuum hypothesis is consistent with the axioms of set theory. 

For each infinite cardinal number $a$, consider the set $c(a)$ of all infinite cardinal numbers that are strictly less than $a$. If $a = \aleph_{0}$, then $c(a) = \emptyset$; if $a = \aleph_{1}$, then $c(a) = \{ \aleph_{0} \}$. Since $c(a)$ is a well ordered set, it has an ordinal number, say $\alpha$. The connection between $a$ and $\alpha$ is usually expressed by writing $a = \aleph_{\alpha}$. An equivalent definition of the cardinal numbers $\aleph_{\alpha}$ proceeds by transfinite induction; according to that approach $\aleph_{\alpha}$ (for $\alpha > 0$) is the smallest cardinal number that is strictly greater than all the $\aleph_{\beta}$'s with $\beta < \alpha$. The \textit{generalized continuum hypothesis} is the conjecture that $\aleph_{\alpha + 1} = 2^{\aleph_{\alpha}} for each ordinal number $\alpha$.
