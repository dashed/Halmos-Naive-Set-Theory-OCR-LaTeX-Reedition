SECTION 24 CARDINAL ARITHMETIC One result of our study of the comparative sizes ot sets will be to define 9 new concept, called cardinal number , and to associate with each set X a cardinal number, denoted by card X. The definitions are such that for each   cardinal  number there exist gets A with card We shall elso define an ordering for cardinal numbers, denoted &9 usual by < The connection between these new concepts and the ones already at our dis- pogal ig easy to describe: it will turn out that card X card Y if and only if X and card X < card Y if and only if X < Y. (If a and are cardinal number8, a < b meang, of course, that a & b but a = 6.) The definition of cardinal numbers can be approached in several different way8, each of which has its 8trong advocates  To keep the peace &s long as possible, and to demonstrate that the essential properties of the concept are independent of the approach, we ghall postpone the basic construction. We proceed, instead, to study the arithmetic of cardinal numbers. In the course of that gtudy we ghall make use of the connection, described above, between cardinal inequality &nd get domination; thet much of & loan from the future will be enough for the purpose. If a &nd b are cardinal numbers, A and B are disjoint sets with card A a and card B b, we write, by definition,a + b = card (A U B). If C and D are disjoint sets with card â‚¬ and card D b, then and B ~ D; it follows that A U B~ C U D, and hence that a + b is un- ambiguously defined, independently of the arbitrary choice of Cerdinal   addition, thus  defined, is commutative (a + b = 6 + a), and associative (a + ( + c) (a + b) + c); these identities are immediate consequences of the corresponding facts about the formation of unions 94 Origlnal fom e0 by Google UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN and and
