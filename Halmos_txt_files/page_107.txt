\chapter{SECTION 24: CARDINAL ARITHMETIC} 

One result of our study of the comparative sizes ot sets will be to define a new concept, called \textit{cardinal number}, and to associate with each set $X$ a cardinal number, denoted by card $X$. The definitions are such that for each cardinal number $a$ there exist sets $A$ with card $A = a$. We shall also define an ordering for cardinal numbers, denoted as usual by $\le$. The connection between these new concepts and the ones already at our disposal is easy to describe: it will turn out that card $X$ = card $Y$ if and only if $X \sim Y$ and card $X$ < card $Y$ if and only if $X \prec Y$. (If $a$ and $b$ are cardinal numbers, $a < b$ means, of course, that $a \le b$ but $a \neq b$.)

The definition of cardinal numbers can be approached in several different ways, each of which has its strong advocates. To keep the peace as long as possible, and to demonstrate that the essential properties of the concept are independent of the approach, we shall postpone the basic construction. We proceed, instead, to study the arithmetic of cardinal numbers. In the course of that study we shall make use of the connection, described above, between cardinal inequality and set domination; thet much of a loan from the future will be enough for the purpose.

If $a$ and $b$ are cardinal numbers, and if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets with card $A = a$ and card $B = b$, we write, by definition, $a + b = card (A \cup B)$. If $C$ and $D$ are disjoint sets with card $C = a$ and card $D = b$, then $A \sim C$ and $B \sim D$; it follows that $A \cup B \sim C \cup D$, and hence that $a + b$ is unambiguously defined, independently of the arbitrary choice of $A$ and $B$. Cardinal addition, thus defined, is commutative $(a + b = b + a)$, and associative $(a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c)$; these identities are immediate consequences of the corresponding facts about the formation of unions.
