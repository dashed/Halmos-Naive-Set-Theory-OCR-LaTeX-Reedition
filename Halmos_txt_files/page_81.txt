68 NAIVE SET THEORY Sec_ 17 tion of well ordered gets with the property that of any two distinct mem- bers of the collection one is & continuation of the other. A gort of converse of this comment is also true and is frequently useful: If & collection @ of well ordered sets is chain with respect to continuation, if U is the union of the sets of @, then there is & unique well ordering of U such that U is & continuation of each set (distinct from U itself) in the collection Roughly speaking, the union of & chain of well ordered sets is well ordered_ This abbreviated formulation is dangerous because it does explain that "chain" is meant with respect to continuation If the ordering implied by the "chain" is taken to be simply order-preserving inclusion, then the conclusion is not valid. The proof is straightforward If a b are in U, then there exist sets A and B in @ with @ € A and b € B_ Since either or one of A and B is & continuation of the other, it follows that in every case both to some one get in @; the order of U i8 defined by ordering each {a,6} the way it is ordered in any set of @ that contains both and Since @ is a chain, this order is unambiguously determined. (An alter- native way of defining the promised order in U is to recall that the given orders, in the sets of @, are sets of ordered pairs, and to form the union of all those sets of ordered pairs ) A direct  verification shows that the relation defined in the preceding paragraph is   indeed an order, and moreover, its  construction was forced on us at every (i.e., that the final order is uniquely determined by the given orders)_ The proof that the result is actually a well ordering is equally direct. Each non-empty subset of U must have non-empty intersection with some set in @, hence it must have & first element in that set; the fact that @ is & continuation chain implies that that first ele- ment is necessarily the first element of U also. ExERCISE. A subset A of & partially ordered set X is cofinal in X in case for each element of X there exists an element a of A such that I & Prove that every totally ordered set has cofinal well ordered subset. The importance of well ordering stems from the following result, from which we may among other that the principlc of transfinite induction i8   much more widely   applicable than casual  glance might indicate. Well ordering theorem. set can be well ordered. DISCUSSION: A better (but less traditional) statement is this: for each set X, there is & well ordering with domain X.
