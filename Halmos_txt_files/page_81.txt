of well ordered sets with the property that of any two distinct members of the collection one is a continuation of the other. A sort of converse of this comment is also true and is frequently useful. If a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of well ordered sets is a chain with respect to continuation, if $U$ is the union of the sets of $\mathcal{C}$, then there is a unique well ordering of $U$ such that $U$ is a continuation of each set (distinct from $U$ itself) in the collection $\mathcal{C}$. Roughly speaking, the union of a chain of well ordered sets is well ordered. This abbreviated formulation is dangerous because it does not explain that "chain" is meant with respect to continuation. If the ordering implied by the word "chain" is taken to be simply order-preserving inclusion, then the conclusion is not valid. 

The proof is straightforward. If $a$ and $b$ are in $U$, then there exist sets $A$ and $B$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Since either $A = B$ or one of $A$ and $B$ is a continuation of the other, it follows that in every case both $a$ and $b$ belong to some one get in $\mathcal{C}$; the order of $U$ is defined by ordering each pair $\{ a,b \}$ the way it is ordered in any set of $\mathcal{C}$ that contains both $a$ and $b$. Since $\mathcal{C}$ is a chain, this order is unambiguously determined. (An alternative way of defining the promised order in $U$ is to recall that the given orders, in the sets of $\mathcal{C}$, are sets of ordered pairs, and to form the union of all those sets of ordered pairs.) 

A direct verification shows that the relation defined in the preceding paragraph is indeed an order, and that, moreover, its  construction was forced on us at every step (i.e., that the final order is uniquely determined by the given orders). The proof that the result is actually a well ordering is equally direct. Each non-empty subset of $U$ must have non-empty intersection with some set in $\mathcal{C}$, and hence it must have a first element in that set; the fact that $\mathcal{C}$ is a continuation chain implies that that first element is necessarily the first element of $U$ also.

The importance of well ordering stems from the following result, from which we may infer, among other things, that the principle of transfinite induction is much more widely applicable than a casual glance might indicate.

DISCUSSION. A better (but less traditional) statement is this: for each set $X$, there is a well ordering with domain $X$. Warning: the well ordering
